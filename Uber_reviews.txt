 u"        4/21/2017    BOYCOTT UBER!!!My new slogo - They have made me a hater. \xa0I have been with them since almost the beginning - now they are too big for their britches. \xa0I will not stand for it.Driver never showed and had the audacity to charge me for the full ride. \xa0I paid for it, was left with no ride and super late for my event. \xa0I finally called a cab - yes a CAB which showed up, more than I can say for MARIO, Jersey City driver from hell. \xa0If you see Mario as your ride, cancel it asap. \xa0He charged me 100%, for a ride I never took. \xa0Never saw him, ever. \xa0Uber refused to credit my account. \xa0So here is how they do business: \xa0Charge you whatever they want, and never even have to pick you up or be accountable for leaving you stranded. \xa0I WILL NEVER USE UBER AGAIN! \xa0By the way, how about common courtesy for a customer who was been a loyal passenger for years, this is how they treat people. \xa0BE warned, until you face it, you won't believe it. \xa0NO CUSTOMER SERVICE whatsover. \xa0I boycott Uber and will pass the word along as many times as I can.",
 u"        4/9/2017    1 check-in        The driver of my ride canceled when he was around the corner and said I wasn't at the location. I was waiting outside. Uber refused to refund the charge. A few weeks prior someone stole my uber in front of a bar. Which means the driver did not confirm the passenger identity. I'm done. Thank goodness there's healthy competition of services out there.",
 u'        4/6/2017            Updated reviewJust some insight on how my latest Uber experience went. Uber\'s Alyssa had the misfortune of contacting me about a driver who refused to service my pup and me in the winter storm."Hope this email finds you well, Angella. We received a report from a driver of one of your recent trips. The driver reported feeling uncomfortable regarding an argument during your recent trip.Per our Community Guidelines, all users are expected to conduct themselves professionally and safely while using the Uber platform. If we receive any additional feedback of this nature, we may ban your account.Let us know if you have questions."My response -"Hi Alyssa: Yes, thank you I am well. I\'m sorry that I was not given the opportunity to take the recent trip you\'re referring to. I\'m sorry your driver felt uncomfortable when he pulled up and got out the car to shake his head and wag his finger when he saw my pup and me after I waited in the NYC blizzard aftermath for 6 minutes. I\'m sorry his feelings were hurt when he asked me for documentation stating that he had to take me from 140th to 119th street in Harlem and I denied him. I\'m sorry that he decided to debate, berate and tell my fianc\xe9 (a VIP customer) to hit him twice in the ice and snow instead of defusing the situation by swiftly cancelling the ride at my 2x request, getting back inside his warm vehicle, driving off and proceeding with his uber duties. I\'m sorry that he took the professional high road, reported me, and now I too am being considered a candidate for the #travelban (uber), following news reports of uber ceo and #45 in cahoots, me deleting/re-adding the app and using Lyft in protest, and uber ceo\'s spat with one of his own driver\'s. I\'m sorry this had nothing to do with race because we\'re both black, me American, and it\'s not actually black-on-black crime (cause really nobody would give a sh** then, right?). I\'m sorry that I had to take time to write this letter to you after calling another uber driver, who was lovely by the way, to take my pup and me to the vet appointment that the previous uber driver felt too uncomfortable to literally sit there and do, therefore making us late for an already stressful anal gland sac emptying. I\'m sorry. But all the best."',
 u'        4/22/2017    Tried Uber for the first time and it sucked. Driver never showed. Driver (Juan) cancelled my ride without any notification. When I tried to call him after waiting 45 minutes when he was 23 minutes away & we actually spoke on phone prior to his arrival to confirm ride, he never picked up or answered text. So I ended up taking my own car which I wanted to avoid. Then when I contact customer support via email, they REFUSE to address my complaint about him never showing up other than a "sorry". Even after I explain I understand things happen but how is it the driver or company doesn\'t or isn\'t required to notify customer they\'re not showing up?!?!?!?!!? This too they also refused to answer. It also didn\'t help that my driver barely spoke English. Not sure I\'ll give this business another try. I may try Lyft or stick to the old fashion way.....,a Cab! Sorry Uber but you\'d get ZERO STARS if I could."Juan, your friendly NO-SHOW Uber driver"! Haha wtf...really?!?!? You just cancel and leave a person waiting?!?!? Pathetic."Juan, your friendly NO-SHOW Uber driver"! Haha wtf...really?!?!? You just cancel and leave a person waiting?!?!?

 u"        3/20/2017    Generally I like Uber. Last night my driver called and asked for my destination. They are not supposed to do that and I told him so. He hung up on me and then drove around my pick up area but did not come. I called him and was sent straight to voicemail. He then parked 4 minutes away from me and did not cancel the trip for 31 minutes. I was charged $5 and when I disputed this it took over 3 hours, multiple emails, Facebook messages and a call to block the payment for me to get a refund. This was terrible customer service from start to finish. I'll be using Lyft for a while.Requested at 7:02. 26min later Mahmoud is parked 4 minutes away, not even driving.Requested at 7:02. 26min later Mahmoud is parked 4 minutes away, not even driving.",
 u"        4/24/2017    My complaint is with UBER Billing. In all the months I have used UBER here in California, NEVER! have I had an issue with billing. UBER thinks the public is so naivee' that we are not capable of understanding that ones' Pay pal credit account [Not regular Pay pal account] AND bank account have been charged. Because of the reputation that Uber has earned here in CA, we chose to use Uber in NY. What a mistake. After several hours of providing proof to Uber and going back and forth with Customer Service, we have now asked for a Supervisor. They keep responding with literally ludicrious statements. If this is not resolved in the next day or so, we will have to proceed further.DO NOT USE UBER IN NEW YORK !! THEY ARE SCAMMERS !!",
 u"        4/22/2017    Uber customer service sucks balls. You have to message them through the app and then a different person responds every time so they have no context of your situation. I was charged for an Uber pool ride when I purchased an unlimited pool pass. Then they explained I was charged due to surge pricing but the price showed $0 when I requested. So I complained there should be a way to tell if it's surge before I request and they said to uninstall and reinstall my app which I did and then they told me the same thing in a circle.",

 u"        4/6/2017    took four uber rides while in NYC earlier this week- to and from airport, and to and from dinner one night. All times they arrived very quickly. All times the cars were clean, the drivers were dressed nicely and conversant. \xa0One of the times my coworkers were a little rowdier than I would have liked but the driver handled it like a professional and didn't kick us all out of his car. I only take uber black so i'm not sure if the service level is the same with the other drivers but i have no complaints and only good things to say about this services. Nice work :)",
 u"        8/24/2016                Listed in 2016 is here!Uber has definitely changed the way we travel in and around NJ and NYC in the last one year. However, I do have to point out that some of their CS policies are so weak that there's almost no safeguard or safety net for the passenger. I recently got into an Uber to goto Newark Penn station and the driver not only switched off the Uber Navigation midway, but also deliberately took a wrong turn towards Newark Airport. While I was sitting in the back seat and freaking out wondering what the hell is going on, he gave some lame excuse about Uber navigation giving him a different direction to avoid traffic. There was no traffic! He just decided to take me around Newark in a loop. After a few minutes he switched to a different navigation system, and took a roundabout route to eventually reach Newark - costing me $10 bucks more, but causing a LOT of heartache in the process. What does Uber do when you let them know their driver is unsafe and unreliable? They refund me the $10 bucks and give me $5 as a promotion? Really Uber? That's your answer to women's safety. This nutcase is out there doing the very same thing to another unsuspecting female passenger even as I type this.Uber's response to women's safety; $5 credit!!!Uber's response to women's safety; $5 credit!!!Uber does not get it...Uber does not get it...My first correspondence with Uber on this issue (1)My first correspondence with Uber on this issue (1)",
 u"        1/7/2017                Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge 2017Uber: we all hate it (at least here in NYC) but we all still use it.The issue is that if drivers don't spot you within 10 seconds they cancel on you. This is different than anywhere else across the country, where they will attempt to reach out or at least give you more time. You've got to be on the lookout for the driver assigned to you (I hope you're familiar with car models!)That said, Uber is quite often cheaper than yellow cabs, especially if you do a carpool, which usually only adds 3-4 minutes to the route. Take a cab to the airports and the metro to destinations across town or in other boroughs.The first preference is always a real car service. But in a pinch, Uber will do as long as you're where you're supposed to be and have an eagle eye for cars.",
 u"        3/16/2017    Worst service ever. I'm officially done with uber and permanently sticking with Lyft. After I cancelled 2 trips , my credit card was still charged 80 dollars !! I contacted the uber support by e- mail because this company doesn't even have a direct phone line. I threatened a fraud/ illegal pending funds lawsuit if they refused to give me my money back. The second issue was that the uber driver wanted me to walk 5 blocks to meet her! She couldn't pick me up at my door. This is the original reason I cancelled the trip. The second time I tried again to see if the location was mistaken - it was not. The uber indicated I had to walk 5 blocks to meet with her. Mind you , there is no construction nor traffic where I live.. I perceived this as being lazy for a hefty forty dollars. I then called a local taxi (riverside) to take me to downtown only for 28 bucks. Most ridiculous service ever. Stay away from this company.",
 u"        3/31/2017    I never write bad reviews, ever, because I would hate to put someone's business in jeopardy just because I had a bad meal or someone looked at me funny. But this is different.About an hour ago, I was almost ran down by a speeding Uber in a crosswalk here in Brooklyn. I had the light, he didn't. He didn't stop, but another cab driver did, and I raced to get a photo of the license plate so I could report him. When I knocked on his window, I got a half hearted apology. I'm lucky to be alive-one step closer, and I'd be in the hospital.My problem with Uber is: they have no way for a non rider to contact him. I have the app, but since I wasn't a pedestrian, I can't reach them. My only resource is to post a Yelp review, write something on Facebook, tweet them, report the driver to the police. How they deal with the public and safety concerns, says a lot about their company. I will never take them unless it's my only option.",

 u'        3/5/2017    I can\'t deal with the service any longer. I rarely use uber because I prefer lyft, however I have attempted to use uber and always been unhappy. The last straw was when I ordered an uber and upon realizing the location was 7 minutes away the driver decided it was too far so he called saying he didn\'t want to pick me up. Really? I have had multiple issues before this; drivers cancelling because they couldn\'t spot me right away and cancelled without even calling me to clarify which side of the street I was on, or when I was at my school and they were at the wrong entrance. Tried getting my friend home from my place, around 2:30am and the drivers kept cancelling right after accepting the damn ride. Another time, My friend and I took an uber in Brooklyn to Barclays center for a concert and were already running a bit late. The dude was driving like a maniac and we legit feared for our life (talking on his phone and acting shady), then he wants to drop us off a block away, for a concert that is literally just about to start. No. Oh, and I ordered an uber to take me to the Staten Island ferry and the driver calls and is like "oh oops I thought it was in Brooklyn sorry" while laughing and cancels. Really? I am usually an understanding and patient person, but uber has too many strikes for me. Bye Felicia',

 u'        2/12/2017    Uber is the worst car service in the industry!!This new flat fare initiative they are testing out also proves their inconsistency and POOOOR customer service.Based on this flat fare promo, UberPool is 2.99 and UberX is 5.99 within the 5 boroughs and cannot exceed $30.I took a trip to a restaurant and paid 2.99 and upon returning home, UberPool and UberX prices were both inflated! I wrote Uber about it and they have yet to provide me a credit! Use Lyft or Juno instead, anything but Uber!',

I have to bow down to all Uber drivers...... and to my daughter, who taught me and my husband all about Uber...... and to come out of the dark ages. \xa0I have to admit, subways bother me. \xa0I've taken them, but I just don't like dealing with them. \xa0So, for two people who USED TO rely upon taxis (always got some of my best photo opps in a taxi), it can become virtually impossible to catch a taxi (a) during rush hour, (b) in the crowds during Christmas time, or (c) when cab drivers are changing shifts..... and let's not forget how ridiculously expensive they are because they charge by the minute, not the distance. \xa0BUT........ to call upon an uber driver, all's I can say is WOW. \xa0All's I can say is what an awesome concept, and lastly, all the cars are virtually new, incredibly clean, and I can see out of all the windows. \xa0(If you've taken a taxi, you know that's not in the cards.) \xa0Also, the Uber drivers were VERY friendly and talkative... so not the case with taxi drivers. \xa0I don't know why some of these other Yelpers think Uber drivers are so expensive........ I mean, certainly not compared to a taxi. \xa0No comparison.... in fact, soooooooooooo much cheaper with Uber. \xa0The only bizarre thing to me was that we had to always walk to a slightly different location to meet up with the driver, and it didn't make sense to me. \xa0It wasn't like they couldn't get to us. \xa0We were always in great, easily accessible locations, yet they'd make us move. \xa0My (L.A.) daughter said that she never has to do that where we live, but.... a small inconvenience considering how otherwise helpful they were to us. \xa0An EASY 5 stars in my book.",
 u"        9/27/2016    Just a star off for the ridiculous surge prices!Otherwise, Uber is a godsend. No more waiting in the rain or snow flailing your arms around like a crazy person trying to hail a yellow cab. Those days are done!!! The convenience of ordering on your phone and waiting in the comfort and warmth of wherever you are is literally the best feeling. Also the different types of Ubers are useful too: If you've got a baby but no car seat, they've got that! If you're feeling bougie and want a black car, they've got that! If you're the Brady Bunch and need an SUV, they've got that! If (like me) you'd rather share a ride with a total stranger to get a cheaper price, they've got that too! And their customer service team is so helpful. Their response time is extremely quick via email and are always ready to correct any wrongs that you've experienced. That is the definition of customer service! Of course, you might still be unlucky enough to get a driver with a crap attitude once in a while but hey, welcome to NYC.",
 u"        4/10/2017    I spent three days in NYC recently and ordered Uber 7 times. \xa0I have the Uber App on my phone and it is easy and fun to use. \xa0Five of the drives were great. Two drives were cancelled by the driver as he couldn't find my location. \xa0I was charged $5 for each cancellation, but was credited for them by Uber after receiving their e-mail offering an opportunity to explain why I should be refunded. I much prefer Uber over the yellow taxis in NYC. The Uber drivers are friendly, the cars are nice too. \xa0I will definitely use Uber again, and recommend Uber to friends.",

Greed?Look, I'm a fan of Uber and have used it many times, and luckily have been able to not get screwed by surge fees too often. For the most part the drivers are courteous cool cats, and their vehicles are on the newer side with clean nice smelling interiors, cold AC, and working GPS systems.The mobile App on my phone works great and lets me know how many cars are around and how many minutes it would take to arrive. Used Uber when in Montreal recently for a few rides and worked well there too.Oh, and they beat the crap out of Yellow Cabs of which many of them smell like foul body odor, have no working AC, and drivers who won't get off the damn phone!",
 u"        2/9/2017    This is ridiculous. I wrote to Uber three days ago, and still no correction to my problem. I have to be fair and say I did get a response through their Facebook page but I was just given directions on how to correct the issue myself, even though I tried it before I contacted them. I followed their instructions AGAIN, and it didn't work. Now, another day later, still no fix. I wish they had a number you could call and get support ASAP. This back-and-forth is frustrating, and I'm second guessing using them at all.",
 u"        8/21/2016    Awhile back a friend from JC recommend that I try Uber.Initially I just blew it off. Another app on my phone I thought. Boy was I wrong. You know how this works. In this area car service can be spotty to say the least. Uber is dirt cheap compared to others in the Jersey City area. Going to appointments or just out with friends for a night out on the town, Uber is my first choice. They are at my house in 5-10 minutes and the cars are very clean. I find that the drivers are very friendly and personable.I'm always picking there brain about the Uber experience from there angle. Most are working PT adding to the income as a second job. XL is what I take, it's always under $10.00 for this area. Once by my own mistake I shared a ride with someone and it was less than $5.00 for me and was dropped off first.Yes I'm a big fan. :)",
 u"        12/17/2016    I had an uber driver came to pic me up, noticing he was 2mins away I texted to tell him am coming down the stairs by the time I got there he was driving off so I stopped him. He told me to get another cab, I asked why when you are here, he insisted I should get another cab saying he cancelled my trip which he didn't. I told him I don't understand he's right here and hasn't canceled why not pick me up by this time it was drizzling and I was without an umbrella and this driver couldn't give me a reason why he wouldn't pick me up.I watched him drive off and was parked at the bus stop 1/2 a block away without canceling, at which point I assumed he refused to cancel as he didn't want to be charged and was waiting for me to do so. Realizing by now I was late for work, I canceled in hope of getting another cab to take me. However, the wait time had increased so I chose to walk to the bus stop to get the bus.I wrote to uber informing them of the incident and requested my money be returned to my account or that my account be credited as was the case when I was previously charged in error. It's almost a month since I have been writing to uber and although each time I'm sent an apology and an invoice which shows the refund will be given. This is yet to appear on my statement which confirms no refund was made.As I pointed out to Uber, I have never experienced such disrespect and unprofessional treatment from a driver and doesn't plan on using them again which is unfortunate because prior to this incident I took them almost everyday on my way to work and on the weekends for the last several months. I have been a good customer but refuse to pay for this kind of behavior/treatment. Having taken them on a regular basis I noticed how the service has deteriorated but that last incident was it for me. I refuse the pay for a ride I was forced to cancel and want my money back no matter how little it was.If there was an option to give no star that's what I would have given because with the treatment I got that day that driver deserve shit.Uber I want my money back!",
 u'        7/27/2016            Updated review2 check-ins        I\'m lowering them 1 for a few incidents since the last review:1) When it rains in the afternoon good luck getting a car...it\'s not happening.2) Some drivers do not think at all in terms of dropping you off on the wrong side of the street when the car is full forcing you to exit into traffic.3) Today a car actually made 5 stops and at one point had 5 in the car. \xa0And to top it off he never turned on the AC -- kind of defeats the purpose of escaping the hot and crowded subway.July 28, 2016 was also bad. \xa0I requested a car at 8:35 AM to go from FIDI to midtown. \xa0Each time I requested, the app told me to go a few blocks away and then either the driver would cancel or the app would just indicate the ride either was taking place (without me in the car) or that the ride never existed. \xa0I wound up doing this 4 times. \xa0Finally a car and I did connect and the driver indicated that they are having issues. \xa0It would be nice if the app would indicate that. \xa0On top of this, I get charged for 3 rides that never materialized and to top it off it took me over an hour to get to my destination. \xa0(With only one other person in the car)Weekend (not Uberpool) -- All went well. Except the app had a different address for a theater we were going to, but the driver was able to adjust and get us there on time. \xa0Riding back I had to play a slight waiting game with "the surge" but wound up getting a towncar for the price of an UberX.Aug 1, 2016 -- I request and wind up having to walk 4 blocks to meet up with the car. \xa0The car takes at least 10 minutes to arrive even though the app said it was arriving. \xa0Driver allows a another rider in even though she was not on his list. \xa0Car was full in the back. \xa0He then sees I am trying to get in and tells her to get in the back. \xa0She throws a mini fit but gets in. \xa0Driver then drops me off another 4 blocks from my destination.The ride home was just as bizarre. \xa0I get a meeting point 3 blocks away. \xa0I get there and then get a call from a driver who is laughing as he tells me he has to cancel. \xa0I request another and they accept and then immediately cancel. \xa0On try number 3 I get one that is yet another 3 blocks away in a different direction. \xa0We meet up, there\'s one other passenger. \xa0She gets dropped off in the village. \xa0We get close to my destination (about where I was picked up this morning and the driver essentially tells me to get out there) \xa0I get out (again 3 blocks from the real destination) and he passes me while I\'m walking. \xa0I flag him down and ask why he couldn\'t drop me off closer to my destination if he was driving that way. \xa0He claims the GPS told him. \xa0So something is definitely up with Uber\'s pool gps system.Aug 8, 2016 -- Rides have been going relatively smoothly until this morning. \xa0Today the car didn\'t pick me up and the app said I\'m on my way. \xa0Luckily the driver was stopped at a red light. \xa0I knock on the window and he said he had 3 passengers already. \xa0(There was no one in the car) He let me in and proceeded to pick up one additional passenger before dropping me off.Aug 9, 2016 -- Some props to Uber. \xa0They gave me a credit for the Aug 8 debacle. \xa0But better yet, on my ride home, they driver didn\'t want to pick up anyone else and breezed down the FDR. \xa0The trip was a bit over 15 minutes from NoMad to FIDI. \xa0That\'s gotta be a record.',

 u"        5/11/2016    Took my first Uber ride, and didn't even know it!The wife and I had just gotten in to JFK airport in New York \xa0after a 6 hour flight from San Francisco. \xa0We had gotten up at 4am to catch a 40 mile supershuttle trip to SFO, and had been packed like cattle in the economy section of American Airlines airbus 321.We had 2 carry on luggage and 2 day packs, and our first time ever in New York City. \xa0Unfamiliar with the trains and subways, \xa0and so ruled out riding the 17 miles to our hotel near Times Square during the height of the evening rush hour. \xa0Disneyland like line at the taxi stand, with the yellow Toyota Prius V and Camrys taxis in short supply, 6pm on a Friday.We are ready to stand in yet another long line, when a dressed up \xa0Asian Indian dude asks where if we are going to Manhattan. \xa0He leads us over to a late model black Toyota Avalon, parked in the ride share zone. \xa0On the side, shows the blue NYC Taxi and Limo logo. \xa0 The driver takes our four pieces of luggage and puts them into the trunk, before we can even ask what the fare would be.Door opens and we are welcomed with a spacious back seat with leather coverings. \xa0Super clean and comfortable. \xa0We ask what the fare is, and the driver points to a electronic meter, showing a map of the city.Turns out this is a black Uber, with a base fare of $7, $3.75 per mile, and $0.65 per minute, plus $8 bridge toll, but the driver didn't tell us this. \xa0In contrast the fare for a yellow taxi from JFK to Manhattan is a flat $52.50, plus $4.50 rush hour surcharge, plus $8 bridge toll. \xa0Of course later I was to find out that the amount of foot room in a Yellow Taxi is about equivalent to our 6 hours of cramped quarters of the economy section of the American Airlines airbus, due to the hard plexiglass crime prevention wall separating the back from the front seats, ceiling to floor. \xa0 The driver is also an Asian Indian, dressed well, without any smell of cigarettes. \xa0He plugs in the address of our hotel into his GPS device, and we are on our way, with the wife and I always buckled up, not knowing what to expect!Friday, 6pm every expressway is packed bumper to bumper. \xa0Doesn't faze our driver, as he uses the side roads, and exits, to leave and then dive bomb back into the expressway lines of cars, always using his turn signals, and ignoring the blaring horns of cars behind or beside us. \xa0But no sudden braking. \xa0The man definitely knows what he's doing, and would do well in the Indianapolis 500!After about 10 minutes, the traffic clears a bit, and our car is travelling in style at the speed limit. \xa0Looming in the distance is the skyscrapers of the big Apple!Haven't been to the East Coast in 30 years, and it is a cultural shock just watching our driver safely weave his way in and out of traffic, knowing ahead of time which lanes are exit lanes, where to get off, and where to cut corners. \xa0Going through walkways just ahead of crossing pedestrians. \xa0No right of way for people in the crosswalks -first come first served. \xa0Driver doesn't cuss, is very courteous and polite to us, if not to other drivers! \xa0We finally arrive at West 44th street, a one lane, one way street, with all parking spots on both sides of the street taken, and a line of cars behind us. \xa0The driver stops the taxi in the middle of the street, but adjacent to a driveway where cars can still pass us. \xa0Puts on his blinker lights, and taps out the fare on the meter - $118! \xa0Welcome to New York City!",
 u"        10/7/2016    1 check-in        Uber is an American multinational online transportation network company. Which I think they are trying to take over the world. Most smart phones now have the play store app, were you can download free apps, That's amazing. As of August 2016, the service was available in over 66 countries and 507 cities worldwide. In so little time Uber has done so much theirs cab service company that have over 30 years opened and they still have not done this. I guess its all about expanding your business and taking great opportunity like the ones Uber are taking.One of the features that I most like about Uber is how you can place your pick up location and then placed your destination, and it will calculate how much your ride is going to be.The idea of Uber came from these 2 guys named Travis Kalanick Garrett Camp.  Since Uber's launch, several other companies have replicated its business model companies likes....LyftDidi ChuxingKabbeeFlywheelOla CabsJunoGrabShuddleAll these companies are replicas of Uber. I taken most of them and still #1 for me is Uber Rides. Lets talk about the Uber drivers some give you an amazing service. Some just drive around and give you the worst service you can find. Overall most Uber drivers you get are always going to be better than taking a regular base cab service.When you call an Uber driver they have next to there name some stars. If the Uber driver has 5.0 star might just mean they are a new driver or they are an amazing driver. Most Uber drivers I have gotten driven by have a range of 5.8 stars which is good. Sometimes I wonder wow it is so easy to become a Uber driver since a few years back I use to be a cab driver myself and it was so hard to drive to places when GPS service were not so accurate I use to be a cab driver in 2007 lasted 3 years doing it and I hated that job. Now seen how easy it is I might just try to start doing it again.Uber drivers can use a phone or any type of pad to receive calls in the app and to navigate from different GPS apps the ones that Uber most recommend is Google Maps or Waze those are the most 2 advanced GPS apps they provide.I was Downtown Manhattan about 7pm on a rainy day and I was trying to take an Uber ride uptown I guess they were not many Ubers on the area that I was in but the surge prince said 3.1 I was like what the hell is this. so I took the cab just a few blocks. what would of been like $8 or less I had to pay a bit more I was surprised like really! They should remove those SURGE prices that's ridiculous!!Uber still #1 on the list for me but please do something about the SURGE pricing its REDICOLOUS!!",
 u"        5/3/2016    4 check-ins        I've had my share of rides using \xdcber and for the most part I've been nothing short of happy. I believe in its program and I believe they've done a great job providing a service to the community that goes above and beyond.The reason for the 4/5 stars is because i've had three bad experiences. Ranging from a guy being at a different pickup location that wasn't requested by me, my driver canceling my trip, the driver driving in the opposite direction of my location, and also an extremely flirtatious old man. Each time that I've expressed my sentiments using the help portal through the app I received a response in a timely manner. I appreciate the fact that they are concerned about their customers and aim to please.",
 u'        3/16/2017    Used Uber for the first time last night driver called right away to confirm. \xa0The car was clean, driver was clean and friendly. \xa0He was a great driver and quickly got us to our destination. I would suggest looking for a promo code to try it. Will def use again.',
 u'        3/4/2017    Rediculous biz model. drivers can lie, app can break down, traffic jam is always there. None of these is your fault, yet all fees are on you.',
 u'        4/25/2016    4 check-ins        What can I say?- better and more convenient than a yellow taxi- drivers are often just as smelly, though- \xa0Sometimes you might have an issue with your pick-up, or your driver. When that happens, be sure to complain and you\'ll likely get some uber credit in your favor, and that\'s GREAT!- On the flip side: if you ever have a real issue with a driver or ride and you needed to speak to a real, live human, they "currently" don\'t offer phone support...I\'m not feeling that- That said, they\'ve eliminated the whole having to talk to another person to order a car thing. It\'s like the seamless of taxis.They\'ve saved the day many a time when I was too: tired, drunk, late, lazy, sore, cold, afraid of inclement weather, saddled with heavy bags to make it on my own...and they allow me to do all that without talking to anyone. That\'s really all.',
 u"        12/14/2016    A business used Uber courier service. E.T.A. 30 minutes: it's been over two hours at night and there is no way to contact the driver. The business is closed for the night. My package is floating around somewhere and there is no way to call Uber AT ALL. There is no way to contact the driver. Because I'm receiving the package, I can't even go onto the app and make a complaint about it. There's a twitter support line- totally useless so far.You can't have a package delivery service with no customer support phone line.This is a nightmare. Don't use this service. Also if you want to use Uber for a ride, use Lyft instead. The drivers all like it better.",
 u'        5/9/2016    Uber seems to have moved Yelp profiles without actually closing the old one, just changing the name "Taxi Cab Service"... HMMM Not sure who or what or how but I\'m going to just copy and paste my Uber review right back here:While I think Uber is a pretty neat idea in technological convenience, my experience with Uber was fairly miserable. The type of miserable that makes you want to call all of your friends and say "Have you heard of this company? Because they\'re crap and I\'d like to get together with you and tell you specifically how crap they are. Bring your friends and relatives."I had decided to use Uber because of a coupon for a free ride up to $50 which I received from FourSquare, but never did I expect a ride from Radio City to Park Slope would actually -exceed- that amount of money. Ridiculously convoluted and long ride with a driver who clearly had no idea how to get where I was going, despite me continually giving him suggestions (which he continually ignored). What should have been an 8mile drive took this driver 12 miles! \xa0Even better, I know this because Uber e-mailed me my receipt with a little map of just how and where they screwed me over in as much detail as they could muster. All that was missing was the little graphic of me bleeding dollar symbols the deeper into Queens we got before the driver decided to mosey on down towards Prospect Park.I resent at the fact that this ride could have cost me over double what a normal car service would have cost, let alone a cab in traffic. It\'s also fairly sleazy that the client is held hostage with no idea how much this ride will cost until after it\'s over and the driver flashes the price on -his- phone, presses accept and takes your money. I complained to Uber about this and (days later) they apologized and gave me an adjusted $6 credit. Well, hey, I will say good on them for trying to make amends. I recognize this driver was not specifically hand picked by Uber, but the prices and transactions sure are set by them. Any other car service in New York City will tell me before they even pick me up how much this ride will cost... and it has never come near the ridiculous amount of money this company gouges you out of. No thanks Uber. Slick and flashy app, second-rate and laughably backwards service.',
 u"        1/16/2017    This Review of Uber is overdue.Everyone that lives in the New York City metro area knows that parking your car is very expensive and sometimes impossible.I've had several unfortunate experiences that upon arriving at my appointment or restaurant there is No parking available at all. Welcome to New York Queens metro area! After driving in circles around the block with your new car. You can't just leave it anywhere so you have to cancel your plans. An Unacceptable option.The restaurant that I was going to had No parking lot and was in a neighborhood that had No parking allowed on the streets. What's a person to do.. I'd heard so much about Uber and that the first ride was Free.Rather than take my personal vehicle I decided to try Uber.I downloaded the app and uploaded my info and sure enough the picture of the Uber driver was on the way.I had read so many Horror Story reviews about Uber rides and didn't know quite what to think, but the car was clean and the driver was courteous, our ride was quick and uneventful. My friend and I were pleased which the experience.I thought, Gee this is just great, I won't have to take my car everywhere I can just take an Uber.I was led to believe that my first ride was free and even tipped the driver $5 in cash.Evidently there was a promo code that we were supposed to use but we did not know about Thatbeing our first ride.When I got my credit card statement ,I saw I was charged for the ride.There are many other ride options available here in the Queen's area.I'm sorry I had a disconnect in benefiting from a positive initial Uber experience.JIM",
 u"        3/16/2017    Got snowed in and canceled flights for 2 days. Flew into LGA but would have to wait 5 days to get same flight out for the 3 of us. \xa0Quicker to fly from Newark airport but that's a long way from the airbnb we were staying at in Harlem. We scheduled an Uber and he was promptly arriving at the exact time scheduled despite crusted snow on roads and single lane traffic on the side roads leading to our location. He got us to the airport bypassing traffic jams going into New Jersey as well around the airport. His Yukon was extremely detailed and clean. His name is Osmario Veiga and his # is646-573-2932 and I would recommend him highly. The last star is that there was a little difficulty with language but we don't get out of Oklahoma often so may have been on us. Courteous,nice and clean. That's all we could ask. And MUCH cheaper than a cab or limo. If I can ever get family to NYC again, and that's doubtful, even in warmer weather, Osmaio is who I am calling for sure",
 u'        3/28/2016    Don\'t use UBER in NYC. \xa0Especially don\'t use from JFK to anywhere in Queens. The drivers will accept you as a ride, leave you hanging and waiting while they surf on Lyft or the other services, looking for a more lucrative fare. \xa0If they get a better ride from a different service, they mark you as "no show", and then YOU GET CHARGED FOR THE RIDE!!! You are left standing there in the cold breathing jet fuel fumes, you pay for the abuse, and the Uber overseas email people will deny your appeal. \xa0Please see the text message below where the driver is asking me to cancel the ride, and then he cancels me! The next driver called me and told that his name was "Ali Baba"! I asked him to repeat, because that was not the name given on the map. Clearly dishonest, and doesn\'t make passengers feel safe. Please see the review by Tanja K., and many others, who had the same experience.Here is my card being charged $10 each time the uber driver is a no show but marks me as a no show.Here is my card being charged $10 each time the uber driver is a no show but marks me as a no show.',
 u"        12/27/2016    I've been using uber for 2 years and counting. This is the best taxi business to take when your car is not available. The prices are okay, and the drivers are friendly. I don't understand why the other reviews are bad.The app is very user-friendly ...from ordering a ride, tracking the car to paying for the ride. On a couple of occasions, the drivers cancelled on my uber pool requests last minute to my dismay but overall experience has been outstanding.",
 u'        9/10/2015    Hang on to your bottoms and buckle up! These NYC UBER drivers mean business when they\'re navigating through these city streets - horns blaring, brake checking, muttering expletives, yup, the whole enchilada. You want to feel frightened, but they assure you that they know the ins-and-outs of the city and take you on a whirlwind through side streets- and magically through -pedestrian and taxi traffic. Taxi cabs rack up to $20-30+ quick! UBER transportation fare typically ranges from $7-$15, depending on the destination within different landmarks in the city - such a great deal! Keep in mind that UBER does surge charging and rates will be much higher if and when the demand is higher in the area that you are requesting a ride (for example: Times Square) - just be sure to do your UBER fare estimator before you agree to any rides! That will save you from a lot of confusion and price gouges. Also beware that you will incur a cancellation fee of $5-$10 if you cancel once you\'ve already agreed to take a ride! *the more you know :)The drivers we met were all characters! One driver had to have about 20+ "black ice" tree air-fresheners (you know what I\'m taking about) dangling from his rear-view-mirror and when we asked him about them, he replied nonchalantly, "I\'m not tryna smell no one." We couldn\'t help but laugh and tell him he\'s on to something. He nodded in satisfaction; a seasoned UBER driver.We also encountered some unexpected, deep conversations on some of our rides. One guy, I swear he was a gypsy, was very philosophical and also went as far as commenting on my fianc\xe9\'s mannerisms to the T! Not gonna lie, it freaked me out a little bit. But he was an extremely smart and insightful kid, so I respect his level head & his hustle.We really enjoyed the local flavor and the insider-tips we picked up through our drivers. This is the only mode of entertainment, I mean transportation, which I would recommend other than subway or by foot since it is cheap and efficient! Remember to buckle up! You will, I repeat, -will- get whiplash. Hang on & enjoy the ride (AND conversation!)20+ "black ice" air-fresheners in the rear view mirror. I asked him why - he said, "I\'m not tryna smell no one." LOL smart man20+ "black ice" air-fresheners in the rear view mirror. I asked him why - he said, "I\'m not tryna smell no one." LOL smart man',
 u'        9/21/2016                Listed in Nonsense$5 to get from Christopher St to the UES.When I got picked up, there were 2 cute chicks already chillin in the ride.Prodeep (driver) rolled up the tinted windows once I got in.Felt like I was in a porno movie.Cue my music.Boomchickawowow',
 u"        3/31/2016    If you're a first time user of Uber you can find codes for a free ride, either Uber will automatically give it to you (check the app), or look online for promo codes. \xa0Once you've used Uber they will give you your own personalized code which you can share with friends, if your friends use that code they will get a free ride and so will you.I've been ubering the shit out of this city on a recent visit. It's quick, reliable, relatively inexpensive and super convenient. Another plus is that the app gives you an estimate on your ride before you order it, eliminating unhappy Uberraschungen upon arrival (high five if you understood that pun!).I know the whole idea is to rideshare (Uberpool) and yadaya, but homegirl doesn't play well with others. That defaults me to UberX or Black in NYC, either which way all cars we've 'had' were fine. All were late model vehicles, well-maintained and clean smelling (golf claps for Febreze). The longest we've had to wait has been maybe 4 minutes which isn't bad at all. The reason it took longer was because of a very annoying glitch in the app. Each time I manually changed the pickup location to the actual address of where we were at, though twice (after double checking everything) it overrode my input just as I'd hit the order button. This would result in confusion on the drivers end and delays and annoyance on my end.",
 u'        1/28/2017    Promotions are very deceptive and App lacks transparency about which promotion is being used!Be careful, Uber is out to get your money and customer service will not compensate you even though you are right!',
 u"        9/5/2016    I was previously a fan of Uber, but not anymore.I had a series of issues relating to the pickup aspect of several recent trips. \xa0On more than one occasion, upon being assigned to a driver, the driver \xa0proceeded to drive in the opposite direction instead of to where I am. \xa0I would later learn that drivers do this when they don't want to take the fare, so they get you to cancel the trip so that they can collect the cancellation fee. \xa0There are several variations on this. For example, one driver came to me but then passed me by. \xa0When I began texting him to find out where he went, he gave useless 2 word answers and ultimately canceled the fare...but I somehow got hit with the cancellation fee.The common denominator in these scenario is that drivers put you into situations that will invariably lead to a fee being charged when they don't want your fare for whatever reason. \xa0Problem is that customers shouldn't be charged fees when the driver cancels or when the driver acts unethically.I'm particularly annoyed that when the driver cancels and I get hit with a fee, Uber acts dumb and pretends like they don't know who cancelled the fare. \xa0Uh, no. \xa0You know exactly who cancelled it. \xa0When I complained to Uber, they didn't give me a refund but rather an account credit. \xa0When I proceeded to complain about the credit (rather than a refund, like they should have done in the first place), they finally gave the refund. So, on top of the hassle with the drivers, Uber itself has gone corporate with their attitude toward complaints. \xa0No thanks.There are other issues with Uber concerning the ride itself (on the increasingly rare occasion that the pickup is successful), but there are plenty of other reviews that cover these issues. \xa0I'm focusing on the pickup because it's happened many, many times in the past few months.I'm done with Uber. \xa0Far less hassle with taxis and the taxis have their own ride hailing app now too without surge pricing. \xa0I'm hard pressed to find any advantage to Uber anymore.",
 u"        2/23/2017    My wife and I attempted our first uber ride. \xa0Her company was paying for service for ride to airport and back , great! Let's do it! Schedule the night before for 4:15 pick up to Newark airport for 6:05 flight. After 4 drivers canceled on us even after speaking to one of them on the phone confirming that he wanted extra $$ , my wife and I jump in our car race to airport barely making flight . Never again will uber be used for time sensitive transport.",
 u"        1/26/2017    I don't usually write reviews, much less bad ones, but this is getting to be ridiculous. What in the world is going on with Uber these days? They're doing this partnering up thing with Google with the idea that they'll take $15 off your ride. It's the worst because there's no rate that is set before you agree to take on the ride. Last time, I took an Uber only because Uber Pool said it was going to be $8-10. It ended up being a $26 trip. It's as if the discount is a scam to get you to use Uber and no one's really losing anything except you. I like to know exactly how much I'm going to spend, not get scammed at the end of an almost HOUR ride between FOREST HILLS QUEENS and ASTORIA, which should have been at MOST 30 minutes, but that wasn't the case. Of course I didn't know this either because the Google app didn't show me an arrive by time either. Zero transparency much? I used to like Uber because I knew exactly what I was getting for how much. Now it's feeling pretty scammy. I decided to give it a another try because maybe it was a circumstantial fluke the first time. Still no improvement except that now if I cancel because the driver showed up at the wrong place and is rude and deflects blame about it when I try to give him the correct address, and on top of it all is making me late because it's already been way past the time he should be here, I get a cancellation fee that only goes towards my Uber account instead of my bank account. It's like now you have to use it again because that's just money down the drain if you don't. How about you stop taking advantage of your used-to-be loyal customers Uber? Wtf?? I might just have to try out Lyft or any of the other up and coming driving services out there.",
 u'        4/1/2017    They are the worst. Their drivers constantly cancel and then they charge you a $5 cancellation fee for your wasted time. If you complain you will get a $5 credit, not a refund. Crazy! Btw I called and confirmed the pick up location with this driver. What a jerk to then let me wait a long time before cancelling. -10 stars!',
 u'        1/17/2017    Uber has gone to crap. The selection has dwindled, the cars are overfilled on the pools. They have just become irrelevant at this point.',
 u"        9/15/2016    Was in downtown NYC at Starbucks across from Battery Park. There were dozens of Taxi's and several Ubers on my phone. Figured now would be a good time to test my new Uber App having never tried Uber before.I set my pickup point and my end point selected the XL and the app said who my driver was and that he was only a block away. But he turned around and went the other direction, why? Then it said he was arriving but never showed up. Was standing in the hot sun with my wife for 25 minutes and he finally went off in another direction. I cancelled the ride and was Charged $5. I then tried to remove my credit card and close my account and found out you cannot!What is with this? No customer service number, no way to reach anyone. This company is a ripoff and I am not so sure about the competence of their drivers after seeing this.",
 u"        2/14/2017    My uber driver Malkit stole my prescription medication and claims he threw it in the garbage can but it's no longer there when he went back 5 minutes later.He knew it was medicine for someone very sick and never got in contact with me just cancelled my trip so he didn't have to bring the medication to me, he kept it for himself.He drives a Honda Accord black with license number T726610C Don't get in the car with him.He steals and is a drip addict!!!!",
 u'        3/18/2017    Done with uber. \xa0Made me walk two large city blocks on a cold, rainy day. \xa0I was just off bus with 70 pound suitcase. \xa0The car left and charged me a cancel fee. \xa0I ended up taking a taxi out of frustration. \xa0No more uber for me!',
 u"        7/19/2016    Uber once the darling of the cars service world has officially in my view gone to crap.In my last five rides I have had a serious complaint Every timeOver chargedTolls charged where none appliedDrivers cutting off NYPD cruisers and getting multiple summonses Drivers simply blowing off call commitmentsAdd to that ever rising prices and crap attitudesI'm doneAccount canceledApp deletedNasty email sentUber take your service and stuff itYou suckNo longer goodNo longer competitiveNo longer customer service friendlyGet out",
 u"        1/28/2017    Be careful of their promotions. If you have more than one, the app doesn't tell you that the last promotion added will be the first one used. Then customer service will come up with as many excuses as possible not to compensate you for the App's lack of transparency!!Lyft and GETT tell you exactly which promotion you are using and how much you will pay!Be wary. Uber is out to get your $$$.",
 u'        1/8/2017    Great concept but downgrades for the following reasons:-Biggest complaint: Prices change literally minute by minute as the drivers game the system by signing in and out.-Many drivers just do not know their way around NYC , especially the bridges, routes to the airports, blocked streets, etc. \xa0They rely on a GPS that frequently picks the longest, highest traffic or most expensive route.-Original estimates of when to expect the car are always less than the time shown after a driver accepts you. \xa0I suspect this is because many drivers accept a fare when it is difficult to reorient in the right direction or otherwise reach you because of traffic or one-way streets. Be prepared to cancel and and start again. -There is no live customer service. \xa0The email system works somewhat, but you need to go through lots of menus to find your issue.-We are suddenly getting lots of "pending" activity on our credit card, mostly wrong amounts billed as we enter the car. \xa0We are dropping American Express and switching to another card to see if that works better but getting duplicate or wrong charges means more work fixing the issues.-We do not like the rating system. \xa0Drivers should not be rating passengers based on whether they are tipped; \xa0passengers should rate drivers in a 2 step scale: \xa0acceptable or unacceptable.We know UBER is a work in progress - but we like it better in other cities. In NYC, it needs a lot more work.',
 u"        1/20/2017    When uber first began the idea was fantastic However as the years have come and gone the service has been less than desirable- between the price surge and the funky drivers and the drivers on the phone and no sense of urgency - I think I'm gonna go back to yellow cabs- at least they know how to get you to and from the airport in record times.",
 u"        12/14/2015    UBER saved the day for me... After finding out that my regular car service (see my previous review of Carmel) couldn't pick me up in time to make to JFK, I remembered that I had downloaded the Uber app awhile ago and never used it, so this is my first time experience with Uber. Uber found me a driver in the area immediately, and the total price of less than $30, which is cheaper than Carmel and other car service companies I called.The driver literally arrived in front of my apartment within 3 minutes and made good time to get to the airport. The driver was very nice and I enjoyed chatting with him. He even offered me a bottle of water.When we arrived at JFK, the driver carried my suitcases out of the trunk and onto the curb (most car service drivers leave my suitcases on the street and I then have to lug them to the curb). He also was very polite when I asked him if I should tip him in cash (I wanted to confirm that the tip was separate from the Uber fee) and he said that is up to me. He didn't pressure me to give him a tip at all, which made me happy to give him more than I normally would. I would definitely use Uber again & I hope they can live up to the high standards I have placed on them after only using them one time.",
 u'        7/5/2016    If i can give 0 stars I would. This occurred last night in New Jersey. I did understand surge pricing but assumed the most would be $60 for a less than 20 minute ride. I have taken possibly over 50 rides with Uber and have never even paid over $20 for a ride. We went for the ride as usual from East Rutherford to West New York little did I know the end trip would come out to $142.53. I thought this definitely was a mistake at the insane price for such a short distance so I immediately messaged Uber and they proceeded to give me automated messages on essentially how they can do nothing for me. Because of this situation and another that I was wrongfully priced I will never again use Uber in my life and I suggest you guys do not waste your hard earned cash on them either.SWITCH TO LYFT!',
 u'        3/22/2017    After contacting uber twice about a driver cancellation charge, which the driver cancelled when he was three blocks away from my location, I still have not heard back about a refund, and the customer service contact number is always busy. Will be switching to lyft most likely. Uber is just a bunch of con artists, and even the drivers that are friendly and chatty tell me stories about how uber tries to pay them less than the amount of the estimated fare.',
 u"        3/27/2017    UberX in NY is horrendous. Driver's never look up from their GPS and have no idea how to go around a block. Recently had a driver insisting he was in front of my apartment in the early morning. There was not a single car in the entire block on either side! I tried to explain he was one block away but he could not understand. He cancelled the trip on me. Another did not know how to get from 14th and 10th to 44th and 10th. I did teach him and he was excited about his new knowledge. I'm back to yellow. They know where they are going.",
 u"        7/7/2016    On one hand, Uber is always there for you, on the other, when they raise the price it can come to even double than the usual amount, and that is something I just don't like! Uber is an amazing service, they changed a lot and nobody can take that from them. Yes, they might not be the cheapest option, but from talking to drivers, I hear that they are all very happy working with Uber, and that they are fair. I personally think that this is something which is extremely important.If you are ordering Uber, and they say that the rate changed, make sure you know how much you are about to be charged.",
 u"        10/17/2016    I'm really surprised to see the 2 star rating here when all I see day in and day out, is people jumping into Uber cars or cars with the Uber logo in the dashboard circling around NYC, Hoboken and Jersey City. \xa0I really don't think this rating accurately reflects all of the benefits of Uber so I'm going to share my recent experience with Uber. One month ago, I sprained my ankle pretty seriously and could not walk. I was in my apartment, in my walk-up building and wasn't sure what to do. I eventually decided to order an Uber ride to get me to the ER and the car arrived within 5 minutes. This was on a Friday afternoon, right before happy hour, but I was so relieved that there weren't delays or surge pricing. My driver got me to the ER quickly and made sure to drop me off as close to the ER entrance as possible (without driving illegally on the sidewalk). I also ordered another Uber ride home from the ER and again, no long wait or surge pricing. Since the night of my ankle injury, I've taken Uber 18 times because I can't walk that far yet to get to public transportation into the city everyday. It's not so bad though. I have already racked up $30 in credits since I had to use the service so much and the majority of the Uber drivers I've had have been friendly and polite. I'm really thankful that Uber is in NYC because if this injury happened to me 4 years ago, I would not have been able to get back into my normal routine as quickly. \xa0NYC taxis are hard to nail sometimes and most public transportation is not as accessible (for people who aren't as mobile) as you may think. Uber fills the void of getting from point A to point B quickly and safely. I know the surge pricing can be annoying but Uber does alert you before you book a ride and if you're not getting that message, you should probably update your app. \xa0It's also not that much different than a NYC yellow cab getting stuck in traffic or taking the long way back to your apartment.",
 u"        6/26/2016    You should not hired \xa0drivers with anger issues to drive. Horrible terrifiyng experience \xa0on the road with an uber driver. \xa0I posted some pictures. \xa0I am sorry couldn't get his licence plates .he was horrible  calling me names... got off his car acting as if he was going to hit me..he was horrible  calling me names... got off his car acting as if he was going to hit me..",
 u'        5/13/2016    My daughter booked me am \xfcber this morning to the port authority bus terminal nyc \xa0knew it would cost 2 x the rate but since she had a promo 50% off next 5 rides and I had luggage we chose to do it \xa0when she receive the email with charge the 50% was not taken off. When she contacted uber via email they indicated that promo expired; however when she checked there was no indication of an expiration or any other language that would indicate restrictions \xa0 She told them that and they indicated nothing they could doSo disappointed because she uses uber often and I just signed up. \xa0Needless to say we will not be using them. Just beware of there promos. They lie!!!',
 u"        1/20/2017    The Capital One QuickSilver promo IS A FRAUD. You do not receive a $15 credit, you receive nothing. I've used this card for hundreds of rides and have yet to receive a $15 credit. When I email support regarding this issue, they tell me there is this promo, and I tell them I know, and I haven't received credit, at which point they stop responding. I have sent multiple e-mails to uber regarding this, as I should have a couple hundred dollars worth of credit by this point. Clearly, there is no real promo for the Capital One QuickSilver credit card.",
 u"        3/17/2017    I'm typically very satisfied with Uber. \xa0However, this week after the snow, I am shocked and disgusted that uber is charging twice, sometimes three times the amount just because there is a higher demand. \xa0Shouldn't it be the other way around? \xa0shouldn't you try to help customers when the weather is bad and charge them the same you would usually charge? \xa0I'm going to try Lyft. \xa0If Lyft doesn't disappoint me like Uber has, I am going to be sticking with them permanently. \xa0Uber bad for customers when we need it the most!!",
 u"        6/15/2016    Always liked Uber and I used it a lot...but they really let me down a few weeks ago. I booked a trip to Newark Airport from Upper West Side using Uber Black SUV that had the driver WILFREDO. He seemed very friendly and nice. Little did I know he would take me on a huge detour to the airport so I ended up paying over $200. Luckily UBER offered me a refund of what was extra so that worked out well.In a rush to get out of the car I left behind a black sweater (nothing fancy) and I remembered as soon as the driver left. I desperately tried to call him but no answer. Over and over again and nothing...I tried and contacted UBER on their app, they gave me a standard reply. The issue would be hopefully resolved in a few days. Okay...After my boyfriend and I still keep trying to contact UBER (it's almost a week now) we finally get a reply that the driver didn't find anything...How could he not find anything when it was on the back seat? Maybe he was just frustrated and threw it away since we've made so many complaints to UBER on his behalf...Who knows? The point is..I will never know..and I'll never see my sweater again. No big deal, just the IDEA is horrible.Please be careful when using UBER...imagine if I left something important?? bye bye I would never see it again...Sad.",
 u"        11/28/2015            Updated reviewIt saddens me to downgrade this review because I have always loved Uber. However, recently I have actually avoided using this service for several reasons:1) Seems like Uber is already surging here in NYC. Literally right when you need one, the price is ridiculous.2) Drivers have gotten a lot more terse and the entire experience has become a lot more taxi-like. Much less personal than before. 3) Consistently more expensive than all of its competitors. 4) Has random technical glitches where the driver just doesn't answer the phone. Uber is still extremely convenient and owns the industry, but if it doesn't hold itself to the standards it started out with it will be overtaken by the myriad of other up and coming players.",
 u'        9/30/2016    Still a lot of work to do tech-wise, but always reliable rides via promos.',
 u'        5/5/2016    I used to think Uber was a great service and used it frequently, however, if you actually have the misfortune to experience a serious incident with a driver, you will learn the hard way that Uber do not care about their customers whatsoever. I had a horrible incident with a verbally aggressive and scary driver and reported it to Uber immediately, flagging it as a "serious incident" per their system (note: you have to contact them online, they have no customer service phone number). After over 2.5 hours and several messages from me, they finally reached out to see what the issue was. Things went downhill from there. They told me it would be investigated by a special team that would reach out within a few days...nothing. When I reached back out I was told they "were not at liberty to tell me anything else about the process" and that was that. All follow ups by me were then ignored. I am nothing short of appalled at the way they deal with serious incidents, and the general lack of a duty of care to their customers. I really can\'t stress enough - if you use uber, you better hope nothing bad happens to you, because they certainly won\'t care, and you\'ll be left very upset and frustrated by how you\'re treated.',
 u"        10/5/2016    I started taking a lot of Uber cars once they became cheaper than a yellow taxi. I travel before rush hour, so surge prices were not usually an issue. I would just take a yellow taxi if they were in surge. The bad thing about Uber is that the time quoted on the app is not accurate at all. You usually have to double it or more. Uberpool is a different beast. Price is good but you really have to wait a long time for the car to arrive even though it claims to be 4 minutes away. They tend to get packed and go way out of the way to pick up other passengers. My 20 min commute easily becomes at least 45 min with Uberpool. Plus, the drivers don't look too happy when they pool. Via is a lot better than Uberpool. Minimal wait and minimal deviations from your route. It really doesn't add much time to my usual commute.",
 u"        3/11/2017    Hard to really rate. \xa0 I have been using them a lot during the past three weeks as my husband is in the hospital and I'm too exhausted to drive. \xa0 You can order an Uber X as I did being only one person. \xa0 Had everything from beautiful clean SUV with fantastic drivers to crummy dirty disgusting cars with equally dirty drivers who drove way to dangerous for me, I also will never understand their pricing. \xa0Took the same route all the time at almost exactly the same time. \xa0Left between 5 and 5:30 AM. \xa0 \xa0returned between 10:30 AM and 11:00 AM. \xa0 No traffic. \xa0 Took just about the same time for all trips. \xa0 So I wrote them and was told that some were 10.00 more because of surge pricing. \xa0 Told them to explain. \xa0 \xa0They didn't and gave me a 5.00 credit which I had to remind them about. \xa0 By the way this was not in Manhattan but from Queens to Nassau County. \xa0 \xa0 I also hate that they have no phone number. \xa0 Will not be using them again.",
 u"        10/5/2015    I have a car so I just tried uber for the first time because I needed to go to the airport at such an ungodly hour that I wouldn't dare ask anyone for a ride. My experience had it's up's and down's. Installed the app using a free ride code so that was a plus. Then I tried to schedule my pickup. The first driver called me right away to ask where I was going. I told him the airport, he said he would be right there but as soon as we hung up he cancelled through the app. Guess he didn't feel like going there. The next guy had a longer wait period but I gave him a shot anyway. Waited a while, no call, the car is not moving, eventually had to cancel because I didn't want to risk missing my flight. Tried again and thought to myself this would be the final time before just calling a regular cab. Third time was a charm, the driver was on his way. He was quiet for the entire ride and all I could do was thank my lucky stars for that. I didn't even want to be awake at this hour much less try to make small talk with a stranger. He drove well, there wasn't any traffic. I got to the airport on time and in one piece. The total came out to slightly less than a regular yellow cab would have been. The best part of all my ride was free because of my coupon code, AWESOME!",
 u"        6/12/2016    The app is super easy to use, allows you to grab a cab without hitting up the ATM, gives you the name of the driver, plate #, and type of car they're arriving in (I always screenshot that info to my husband, just in case of an emergency!), and gives you the ability to rate your driver. I love that because I've often felt that Yellow Cab drivers don't care. They'll never see you again and there's not much of a way to complain, other than to the TLC, which is pretty useless. Uber drivers are so accommodating and polite, so I'm all about tipping & giving that 5 star rating when earned!I've had mostly positive experiences with Uber, especially when traveling. It's so nice to be able to rely on quick, clean, comfy, cash-free transportation in a new city without having to worry about navigating. I've used Uber in NYC, Montreal, Orlando, Miami, and Mexico City, to name a few, and I've always been happy to have it. Uber Pool in particular is awesome because it's less expensive and locks in your exact fare(!!!). 85% of the time I haven't even had to share my Uber Pool with others, though I'm sure that will change as the popularity increase. When I have shared, it hasn't meant a creepy passenger at my side or a major detour, so I'm good with that.Occasionally, Uber is a fail. In those cases, though, someone on the customer service/billing end swoops in to save the day. I've had drivers cancel 10+ minutes after they should have been there 3 times, and 2 of those times Uber charged me a cancellation fee. Um, say what?! I was PLENTY outraged, but a message to Uber had it all cleared up & charges removed within a few days both times. Another time I gave a driver 3/5 stars (I'm a consistently generous rater... You show up and get me there? That's a 5-star ride in my book!) because there were 3 of us (I ordered the whole car!) and he got all huffy and annoyed, almost refusing to accommodate us when one of us politely asked if he could move his pile of things so the third person could sit. I wrote that in my 3-star review, and Uber apologized, refunded the ride, and gave me a $10 credit! I felt terrible- I had just wanted to give feedback, not get out of paying for my ride, but I was happy to see they actually read & care about reviews.To summarize: user-friendly app, knowing & having a record of who your driver is, clean cars, nice drivers, affordable rates, no money changing hands... I love it! I wish more local car services would get in board with the app life, but till they do, I'm all about Uber!",
 u"        3/9/2017    Uber service has been horrible in NYC. Every ride I've taken in the last few months (more than 10) have taken at least twice as long to get places as estimated. Many drivers have not shown up for 20-30 min or cancelled altogether. Pool adds multiple pick ups and drop offs that add 30 minutes to an hour of extra travel time. Taking the subway or buses would be much faster even if it's out of the way. The only reason I have used the service is because I've been injured and unable to walk far from the train to my apartment. It has taken much longer than my normal travel time, however, and I will not use the service any more for any reason.",
 u"        12/6/2016    I've been using uber pool a lot lately and one thing that bugs me. It is so confusing to find the car and the meet up time makes no sense. I also take via and via makes so much more sense. With uber it'll say cars 2 minutes away then you hit request car, then it says meet car in 4 minutes. Ok did that today, went to the area it told me to go. Then the time said meet car in 14 minutes. It was raining so I had to go stand somewhere dry. Then the time kept changing. I ended up waiting about 20 minutes when it first had said 4. Ridiculous! At least via is usually right on, and tracks the car. It tells you how far away car is and if it doesn't come in time it gets another car for you that is closer. And if you cancel because they are late via doesn't charge you.",
 u'        11/19/2016    I have used Uber 3 times in 3 weeks, and each time, in addition to the fare that is charged to my debit card, they have placed a "temporary authorization" hold on my card AFTER I ALREADY PAID. When I question the charge, they send a canned response saying "from time to time" they have to validate my payment method and that the hold will be released in 5 to 7 business days. "From time to time"? Try 3 times in 3 weeks, this last time for $30! How much validation do they require? Imagine all that money from all their customers, available to Uber for a week to spend or make interest on. And what about those customers who aren\'t paying attention and don\'t question this fraudulent charge? USE VIA INSTEAD! I have never been charged a temporary authorization charge by them. KEEP UBER OUT OF YOUR WALLET. THEY STEAL.',
 u"        2/13/2015            Updated review29 check-ins        Uber is a great service, plain and simple. It is convenient, safe, and cost efficient if you value time like you would money. In just about every city I've tried it, I have never had a single issue. It's no surprise the taxi lobby is coming after them hard. That said, Uber Black is not cheap. Taxis, for decades, have been generally unreliable, helmed by more sketchy drivers than not, driving fleets of cars that are often dirty and unsafe. I say this as someone whose father and grandfather once drove a taxi way back in the day. I have no biases here. I am just a consumer who appreciates great service and value for his buck.Taxi companies are losing their monopoly and their lobbyists and allies have naturally come out swinging with all sorts of bogus stories, and in some cases, outright lies. Do your research if you don't believe me. Has Uber had some missteps and problems along the way? Absolutely. But it's not like taxi and sedan operators haven't had their share of problems and negative press over the years. And Uber will work out their kinks - count on it. There's far too much money at stake for them not to. Taxi and sedan services are only now scrambling to get their act together because they know their monopoly has been broken. Regardless of whether you agree with this or not, one thing is for sure - change is coming. Taxi and sedan service as you've come to know it will continue to be replaced by more convenient and reliable services like Uber and Lyft. The local taxi companies' days are numbered. They made their own bed over the years. Now they can sleep in it.If you need to get from Point A to Point B and cannot drive yourself, or you simply want to enjoy the convenience of pressing button and being chauffeured around town, Uber is 100% your best option. Otherwise, invest in a good pair of sneakers and start walking.Love me some Uber!",
 u'        3/18/2016    I am getting canceled all the time at LGA. I request a Uber service, the driver calls me to see where I am, and after a few minutes the driver cancels. And I am charged a cancellation fee of $10. Note that I can get the cancelation fee back by going to their website as a credit on my account. The problem is that I cannot use this credit as Uber keeps canceling me.I used to like their service. Now they are becoming worse than yellow cabs.',
 u"        5/16/2016    Just mortified on the fact that a drivers can leave you stranded and you don't even have a phone number to tend to their customers!! \xa0This is 2016 people \xa0 \xa0Uber if u need customer service I'll come in and help but come on!",
 u'        12/3/2016    I received a free ride worth up to $15 for sharing my uber code. The free ride expires in February so I assumed I could use it anytime until the expiration date...I ordered an uber pool which included a promotional price of $5 but instead of uber charging me $5, they applied my free ride. I am certain I chose the option to pay with my credit card, however uber forced me to used my free ride and when I complained to uber they offered me no solution. Unacceptable! I should be able to use my free ride WHEN I choose to up until the expiration date and I should be able to participate in any on going promotions. The main reason I share my code is for the free ride. I will not longer recommend uber.',
 u"        3/11/2016    Everyone, the taxi's have finally beaten Uber, at least in Manhattan. I tried to use Uber four times today without success. \xa0Here is my experience. \xa0On the first call, it took three minutes to connect to a ride. Then the three minute arrival time changed to seven minute, meaning a 10 minute wait for an Uber. Meanwhile, a couple empty cabs went by. \xa0Guess what I did - canceled the Uber call. \xa0A bit later after a business meeting near Stuy Town, I again tried an Uber. \xa0This time it was an 8 minute wait. I jumped in a cab. \xa0Then my wife and I were off to a dinner. I tried again - 1.2x pricing, no problem. Requested the Uber and minutes went by without a request confirmation, I saw an empty cab. Taxis: 4 \xa0Uber:0",
 u'        2/17/2017    Just the worst service. You may like riding in an Uber but trust me this company hates you as a customer. The minute something goes wrong just try and deal with their "service". The guy literally told me I was right but that they just decided they don\'t want to refund me, SERIOUSLY? You admit you charged me improperly but then refuse to refund me saying well we just don\'t see eye to eye and we won\'t.',
 u"        3/15/2016            Updated reviewI requested an Uber vehicle as usual. It arrived and the driver called me to meet him a block from where I was. I told him to come to me and he said he would, so I waited. He didn't come, so I called him again. He pretended like I didn't ask him anything and said he was still waiting a block away. I said that fine, I'll go to him, but he immediately cancelled the trip and left.I requested another car, but was charged a cancellation fee. I wrote to Uber next day after that, but never even got a response on that.",
 u"        2/16/2017    UBERPOOL SUCKS. Seriously. They will make you wait 10-15 minutes at times and if you try to cancel immediately after getting matched with a long eta they will charge you a $5 fee regardless. If you're the first person in you may end up getting matched with 8+ other pools and constants get delayed. They do not limit the number of people you may need to share with. And they may not match you with people on your route. For example, I was going from uws by the river straight down to west village by river and they matched me with someone just east of Rockefeller center (during Christmas time!!!). What normally would take 20-30 minutes took over 1.5 hrs. And they will squeeze 3 people in back seats so you will be on top of people. The subway is more comfortable",
 u"        10/7/2016    Nope! \xa0What works in California DOES NOT WORK in NYC! \xa0An 8 minute wait became 30 minutes for a hellish drive from JFK to Manhattan. \xa0You can't add a tip (any longer, you used to be able to, and I didn't know). \xa0Save time, get a cab!",
 u'        11/1/2016    yesterday an uber driver refused to take me to my destination and told me he was taking me to a hotel in atlantic city, then laughed....i felt so uncomfortable and in danger- i jumped out of his car at a stop sign. \xa0I have been trying to contact Uber since then and Uber responded "sorry for the inconvenience we will credit your account for 5 dollars" \xa0This is ridiculous that a company can brush off a dangerous situation of aggressive sexual harrassment with a 5 dollar credit.....i will get to the bottom of this',
 u'        3/24/2016    I prefer Lyft. Too many of the awful NYC TLC drivers are now running to Uber and trying to recreate the racist and nasty habits they had there. Plus, my first time using Uber was for a car home after an event. The organizers gifted each attendee with a $50 Uber credit to get home. I specifically asked the driver and he assured me the promo would be used not my card. But of course my card was charged. There is no way to get anyone on the phone to correct the situation, so I am stuck waiting for Uber customer service to get back. Unlike Lyft, there is no immediate response from customer service. My driver was a sweetie but I am not amused at having an unauthorized charge.',
 u"        2/10/2016    Mixed reviews: different night and day experiences based on the pick up location matter.. This Yelp listing is for east village, and if that were my only experience I would be horrified. I am unfamiliar w directions around LES and was a little uncomfortable being there when it was deserted, ready to get home. Having just had a say out at speakeasies I wasn't on high alert... So when the guy asked ME to give him directions I routed with my mapquest and shut my eyes to relax - woke up a few minutes later, did not feel we were heading toward home and asking where are we ?? He pulled over and asked if I could give him directions again ... Me: um, no not really... Aren't you supposed to know how to get me home?? He was new so I was kind of understanding - well, to a point. Until we went to Kansas and back (east to west to east side) and what should have been a 20 minute ride was over an hour . He assured me he turned off the meter and I wasn't being charged... I was aggravated but felt sorry for the guy his first week on the job... And even insisted on giving him a tip above what's supposed to be included... Then got an alert on my phone as soon as he drove off that I was charged almost $70 for an hour plus long roundabout excursion. What should have been about $25 for 20 mins and he said wasn't charging me. Zero tolerance for dishonesty especially when I'd been so decent about the outrageous trip, even insisting on tipping him - that floored me most. The positive - I contacted the driver and uber immediately - easy to do from the app- and while the driver didn't respond, uber addressed the issue promptly with a note within an hour saying an adjustment would be made and giving a fair rate . (Hasn't hit my account yet but I'm trusting it will). They have sent at least 3 - 4 follow up emails with \xa0updates / an apology. So the resolution was quick and satisfactory. From the upper east side. I've only used uber a couple other times for my son and his friends when I was in a pinch for a car. I LOVE their services from upper east - I have fully entrusted and had wonderful experiences where I can see the driver's photo, have his phone number, have called once just to check in, and can watch from the app exactly where there car is going the entire route ... Yes, after meeting the guy, getting his plate number, I sit and watch the car driving the entire route on the uber app - and it's been great both times - I can even send updates to another mom on their whereabouts. Fabulously so fabulous. Now if there is a need to use uber I will get the drivers experience level before entrusting uber to take my child as if some driver was driving around the city off route with my son in the car as I watched on the app there would have been one out of mind mamma calling the driver and uber and with 10 police cars on his uber tail ... 2 of 3 experiences were fab - from upper east. The one from LES was a nightmare but gave me a scenic tour of the world and was resolved quickly by uber.",
 u"        9/20/2016    I'm writing in regards to my recent Uber ride in Brooklyn NY. I requested a Uber pickup from my work location to my hotel. \xa0Kevin the Uber driver of a Ford Focus picked me up license plate: T691623C, his driver's TLC license Number 5643340. As we were in route to my destination to my hotel the driver had his radio music station blaring really loud. In an effor to have him turn the radio down, I engaged the driver in small talk. The driver told me he was a native from NYC, he grew up in Bay Ridge which is the area where my job is located. I asked the driver how long has he been driving for Uber he stated 5 months. I asked the driver by chance in route to the hotel would we pass a Apple Bee's along the way. The driver looked up the location's and informed me that there were 3 in the area. I asked if it would be ok to swing by if I placed a order to go. Kevin said yes that would be fine. We pulled up to the Apple Bee's on Dekalb. I advised Kevin that my back pack and water were in the back seat of his car, he said ok. I walked into Apple Bee's to pick up my order, it was taking a little longer than I anticipated. I called Kevin to let him know he said no problem. I asked the server once again when would my order be ready. The server said I didn't have telephone order. I was a little upset because of their mistake. I proceeded to leave Apple Bee's as I was walking out I didn't see the Uber driver Kevin nor his car. I called his telephone several times. My calls were directed to the generic Uber automated line requesting to leave a message. I was extremely distraught. I walked to my hotel in hopes that the Uber driver may have dropped off my back pack do to the fact that he was aware of my final destination. Unfortunately this was not the case. I called 311 to report the incident, I was referred to the NYC police department. In addition I contacted Uber and reached a customer support representative by the name of Christoper. The representative stated that he would attempt to contact the driver, and send me a email with a update. Shortly after speaking with the Uber support representative 2 NYC officer's arrived to take a report from me regarding the incident. The officer's were adamant that I follow up with Uber and hold them responsible for the driver's actions. I explained to the officer's that it was clear theft. The driver was well aware that I left my back pack in the back seat of his car. I advised the officer's that the Uber support representative advised me that the driver Kevin advised him that he set my back pack on the curb. I contacted Uber several times via email as well as their hotline. As of today I still don't have a resolution. Nor has anyone attempted to follow up with me. My back pack contained personal information, my medications, photo's, my prescription glasses, and several other item's that I can't replace that has sentimental value. My purpose in writing this review is to ensure that Kevin does not do this to anyone else. Clearly his objective was not appropriate and his action's/behavior is malicious with criminal intentions. I've used Uber for several year's and I have never had a experience such as this. None the less I am extremely disappointed with Uber as a company who has not taking any time out to address, my concerns that are now fear's based on one of their driver's actions. I don't feel comfortable requesting a Uber, based on the theft that Kevin committed and the lack of empathy and concern exhibited by Uber. \xa0 **********************************************************************************************************************PLEASE BE AWARE OF RIDING WITH THE UBER DRIVER THAT IS IDENTIFIED WITH THE INFORMATION STATED BELOW.

 u"        2/18/2016    No stars!! The worst in NYC!! And since uber pool just a sucky service!!Don't ever use uber pool!! You never make it!!",
 u'        8/23/2016    It appears that most of the older, and lower scored reviews for Uber appear unde Ridgewood Car and Airport limousine or some shit like thatWell, I\'m reposting my review of UberUber deserves 4 stars because its so damn convenient but I give them 1 star for execution.I\'ve used Uber more than a dozen times. Again, its super convenient and most of the cars are in pretty good condition but thats where the raves from me end. Now for the rants...Rant 1Their drivers take the most indirect, time consuming route to get you from point A to point B. Unless your destination is directly down the street, you will be taken for a ride. In principle, NYC taxi\'s and Uber charge the same way \xa0- Base fare + distance + time. While NYC cab drivers understand this concept, Uber drivers seem to be a little slow at learning: There is more money for the driver when they get you to your destination and out of their car faster so they can pick up the next ride! Instead of following this easy concept, they take the most ridiculously long and time consuming routes and when you question them about it, they respond with one of two rehearsed answers for you: 1) they have to follow the GPS which is clearly set for the scenic route or 2) They\'ve been driving in NYC longer than you\'ve been out of diapers. If you don\'t believe me, use the GPS on the phone you used to order the car and compare their route. And the dumbest thing of all is that they email you proof of their dishonest practices when it maps out your ride on your receipt!Rant 2Surge pricing. How about price gouging? There is no difference between Uber\'s surge pricing and the corner deli charging you 3x\'s more for batteries during a blackout yet the store gets fined for that business practice. Even livery drivers in NYC have gotten fined for this yet Uber thinks it\'s justified? The CEO argues this and even puts on his bully hat (prick) on Facebook by starting his response with "get some popcorn..." Uber\'s excuse is that adding surge prices ensure that there are more drivers on the road.What kind of idiot thinks this makes any sense at all? Don\'t answer thatDo restaurants charge more during peak dinner hours in order to staff the restaurant or to make sure there are tables available? Drivers will be on the road because they don\'t make money sitting on their asses at home!!! If Uber really believes this BS philosophy, then the entire surge price amount would be given to the driver but guess what... it doesn\'t. Uber still takes a full 20% for the entire fare so they make more money as well.I\'m sure some jerk off is going to read this and think "hey buddy, take a bus if you can\'t afford Uber" To that I\'m gonna say go F yourself. Look at the places I\'ve reviewed - Do you think I can\'t afford a freaking ride from a car service? \xa0It\'s not about the money, its about getting ripped off so go play in traffic.I\'m all for making as much money as you possible can but at least be honest about it and make no excuses for it. Fortunately for Uber, their service still is convenient and people will continue to give them business until they piss off the wrong class action lawyer to sue the hell out of them... and then I will laugh my ass off',
 u'        1/20/2016    The problem with Uber is that it\'s a crapshoot. The quality of your ride will depend mainly on the type of driver you get. Some are fantastic--others are idiots. Some experiences I have had:1) Several drivers wanted me to walk up my block and cross the avenue to get to their car. If I am paying for car service, the car should be at my door. Otherwise, I may as well be taking the subway. This situation occurred several times in which I had packages and laundry.2) The driver asked me to walk up my block and meet him across the avenue. When he saw I had my little dog with me (under 20 lbs), he left and charged me a $10 "waiting fee." I had to contest this with Uber. Luckily, their customer service is very efficient and they refunded the fee. 3) One Saturday, three drivers cancelled on me in a row because I had my dog with me. They were all Muslim and refused to have a dog in their car. If you refuse to pick up dogs, it should be VERY CLEAR to the customer at the outset so they can bypass you in favor of a driver who can do the job.',
 u'        11/24/2016    Got started here. Good customer service. There are a few diffrent personalities. Get your defensive driving and medical for free. Coffee if you need it. Quick and easy.',
 u'        1/29/2016    Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice....The last straw: Uber pool ride that always costed me approx 30 min and $32 was now over 1 hour and $45. The driver made a mistake and attempted to drop me off at the wrong location making up + 7 miles. uber support tells me, "sorry, the fare was priced correctly. But we\'ll give you $5 credit." Thanks, but no thanks Uber. I deleted you from my phone, installed Lift and now I\'m paying $25 for the same trip! I\'m a New Yorker and there\'s plenty of fish in the sea.',
 u"        10/17/2016    Uber Pool pathetic from JFK to lower Manhattan.3 customers, no communication on routes, 1.5 hour non fulfillment of trip - upon dropping off second passenger driver announced after I questioned why he was going wrong way \xa0- that I was in UberPoll and he had another picker up uptown....true story no embellishment. I made him stop and told him to credit my account for non compliance - he didn't. Uber's resolution - $5 credit ....I had to take a cab to my destination resulting in a 2 hour trip mid day, mid week - epic fail. Avoid at all costs.",
 u'        7/17/2015    Never had a bad experience using this service. The prices seem to be way lower than what an average taxi would cost in most cities. For example, I took a cab from downtown Newark to the airport for less than $9. I\'m certain a city taxi would have cost at least double that.The exception to this generalization may be Uber\'s "surge price" hours, which seems to be a scam at times and is the only reason I\'m going with 4 stars.When I\'ve had to cancel and thought I was wrongfully charged a cancellation fee, I e-mailed them and was refunded within 24 hours, no questions asked.',
 u"        8/29/2016    The concept of Uber is outstanding but the service is devastating. The way it is set up basically anyone who owns a car and satisfies a few minimum requirements can become a driver. So you find yourself being driven somewhere by people with no real experience driving around the City.I've asked drivers to take a different route than that mapped out by the app because I know traffic will be bad, but some don't seem to care/don't understand me/don't know what they're doing. They just drive you through the horrific traffic. Or they take a ridiculously long and timeconsuming route because they are not familiar with streets and traffic.Uber Pool is even worse. In multiple occasions, I've left my apartment with plenty of time to spare on my way to work. The app not only sends the driver through the longest/most traffic jammed route, but it also keeps adding riders at the last minute, forcing the driver to turn around and go around multiple blocks to pick up somebody. A 20 minute ride turns into an hour and I get to work late. And it doesn't help when the police decides to close One Way Only roads and the driver, who's already taken you on a ridiculously long drive, is forced to make it even longer.Fees are stupid too. I've been matched with drivers that are 10 mins away and driving in the opposite direction for where I am, but if I try to cancel, they charge me a fee! It's unbelievable.I think I'm going back to using taxis!",
 u"        11/23/2016    Terrible! Uber hires anyone! Drivers don't follow GPS and they don't find the address you get charged a cancellation fee ... also uber is very deceiving, you open the app it's shows tons of cars and a eta of 2 minutes you request it \xa0eta now 14 minutes you cancel right away and you still get a cancellation fee! Avoid and use lyft!! Much cheaper and run promotions",
 u'        1/26/2017    Uber is slipping. I requested a ride to my home address this morning so that I could be above ground (i.e. not in the subway) for a conference call. After clearly entering my address for pickup Uber indicated that the driver would pick me up five blocks away. This was not a ride share and the driver had not dropped off anyone at that building. There was no value in his meeting me somewhere that was inconvenient to us both, it cost him valuable waiting time.',
 u'        10/11/2016    Hey everyone in Brooklyn. Uber just announced that they are only charging $8 or less to and from anywhere in Brooklyn for the rest of the year!!!!! Ooooouu',
 u'        10/1/2016    Very disappointed with first time using app. Our uber driver cancelled at the last minute after a 10 min wait for him in front if the Marriott Marque. \xa0We had to get a yellow cab or be late to an event. Decided not to chance another uber. \xa0 Dumping my uber app.',
 u"        7/20/2016    I've seen their drivers act aggressive and drive dangerously , drivers need training before getting able to pick up passengers .",
 u"        8/18/2016    I'm a driver! The people that responds to requests lacks basic comprehension skills. They don't understand basic requests!",
 u'        12/9/2015    I used to love Uber - my fiance and I both used it often over the past couple years. But when I needed customer service on two separate occasions, they did absolutely nothing. We had a driver once who literally drove us around in circles to run up the fare. We noticed it happening while in the car and told him to stop, and we contested the fare with Uber immediately. They said drivers can pick their routes, and it looked fine to them. The second time, a driver left the meter running 10 minutes after we got out of the car, driving around our neighborhood. You can see him zig-zagging on the streets around our house (during a 2.1x surcharge, mind you). Again, we contested that portion of the fare and were told it was "within the range of prices for that trip." When I told them I didn\'t care about the range, just paying for the trip I actually took, they basically told me to shove it. Fortunately, there\'s Lyft, Via, Gett, and others, so let\'s see how their customer service is when I need it. I\'d rather go back to regular old taxis than take Uber again.',
 u"        7/25/2016    Regular uber is great, but uberPOOL is horrible. \xa0I once requested an uberPOOL ride by mistake. \xa0I had to cram into the back of a small car with another passenger who was swearing loudly on her cellphone and using a lot of racist language. \xa0Then I had to wait when she asked the driver to stop at the liquor store. \xa0The uber app and navigation were really bad. \xa0I almost gave the driver a poor rating, but it wasn't his fault. \xa0UberPOOL saved me a little money, but wasn't worth the miserable experience.",
 u"        2/4/2017    As a blind person, I am not the typical passage but I will make a few observations about this car service; if you use the pool option, they generally will not wait for you at all, may not contact you if they don't see you and will hit you with a cancellation charge as they drive off! I have also encountered some extremely rude and nasty drivers that will not even get out of the car for a moment to help me because I can't see where if the car is, I have been dropped off at the wrong destination and when using the pool service have had to deal with either drunk, mean or just plain rude fellow passengers; last time we had to stop, so the passenger could throw opt out the open car door! Also, when using pool, they may pick up people that are actually on your route, which can add considerable time to your trip; That last sentence was people that are not on your route, damned text to speech! Anyway, for most non-blind people, you will probably still experience these issues because I hear them all the time",
 u"        8/24/2016    This review is for Uber Pool. When $5 commuting fares started, I used it all the time and it was fairly quick and efficient. Now, it is more popular and Uber will match drivers with up to 4 people - meaning three strangers are crammed in the back seat with each other like a clown car - totally inappropriate and uncivilized. The price is nice, but not for that discomfort, especially if you're a woman crowded in with odd men. That's worse than taking the subway! A middle seat doesn't qualify as an actual seat so stop counting it as one. Routes have also steadily gotten more inconvenient and loopier.",
 u'        8/31/2016            Updated reviewOnce again they cancelled this is the most outlandish company ever stuck at \xa0midnight at the Scarsdale train station and they cancelled 5 min later because the driver said 7 miles away was to far',
 u'        1/4/2017    Uber is notorious for bait and switch. They really need drivers to the point that they will promice you that you will make $1500 weekly guaranteed. Once you atart driving qith uber they begin to find ways to pay you as low as possible. Every time i drop off a customer i have to send emails demanding a payment adjustment because im being paid so low. For example i picked up a girl in the financial district and dropped her off in farmingdale long island. My payment was only $66. Luckily i complained so i got my payment adjusted to $103. Every week you have to make 65 pickups a week. If you have an emergency or your car breaks down without fault you will not be paid $1500. My rentes vehicle had a mechanical failure last Thursday. Therefore i could not work to meet my requirement. As i called to complain about my car trouble, the agents from uber told me that they will not compensate be because of this issue. As the conversation went on they told me well we dont care what your issue is if you dont make 65 trips a week you dont get your promotion. I will never work for uber again. I will go to the media and let them know how badly uber treata their drivers! Good luck.',
 u'        12/20/2015    For a really long time, I loved Uber -- but it seems like it\'s going downhill. I\'ve had some bad experiences lately. I want anyone at UBER in training and any driver who is reading this to understand something. You think you are an independent contractor -- that\'s fine -- but when you click that you\'re accepting my request THAT IS THE SECOND YOU BEGIN WORKING FOR ME. You need to be responsible to get to where I am, EXACTLY where I am (and I don\'t use pins -- I put in the address) and if I\'m standing on the opposite side of the street from you, then you better turn it around and park exactly in front of where I\'m standing. And when I ask you to drop me off at a specific place. You had better drop me off right there. I want to talk about some of the bad experiences I\'ve had lately:1. Driver yelled at me because he couldn\'t figure out where the address was.2. Driver yelled at me and refused to pick up my son because he was too stupid to figure out where the address was. You have an address, you have a GPS -- what\'s the problem? 3. Oh, the problem is that for a year, Uber\'s map has been telling my driver to pick me up on the block behind my house -- not my front door.4. This is the best: I have a small dog I sometimes travel with. This is a small dog that sits on my lap -- short hair, no shedding, no scratch marks on seats. I travel with a clean scarf to wrap around the dog. No driver has ever told me he wouldn\'t take a dog -- if a driver had done so, I would have gladly canceled and gotten another ride. So, this one driver with crappy seats tells me my dog has to be on the floor -- fine -- then tells me my rating is going down because people are giving me low stars for having a dog. WTF -- why doesn\'t someone just tell me? Because these drivers love getting revenge on any customer that bugs them -- read Uberpeople or the Reddit forum. 5. This one\'s my favorite. If you\'re someplace where there\'s a surge happening and, as you know, surges go up and down very quickly and erratically. If a driver knows that there\'s surge pricing happening in their area, and you wait patiently and sneak in with a regular fare or a 1.2 or something -- they will cancel those rides -- kind of like the reverse of what you\'re doing to get the lower fare. I actually ran quite a lengthy experiment with this. 6. I\'ve had several drivers, recently, that pull up across the street and wait. That is unacceptable.7. I\'ve had the stray driver get "lost" -- and then be like -- whoops, sorry -- there has to be some accountability for this. 8. I had a driver pick me up at LaGuardia and I was on my phone and looked up and I was on the city streets in Astoria -- and I\'m like -- what the heck -- why did you do that -- why didn\'t you take 287? I was going to the BX -- he wanted to take me all the way through Queens to the Manhattan to cross a bridge to go up the FDR -- so "we could avoid the toll." Seriously? This is robbery.Now, here\'s the deal. Livery cabs, like First Class and Seaman, etc., have their drawbacks, but they NEVER, EVER act like some of the Uber drivers. Some Uber drivers are ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL -- and for a long time, most of them were -- I think that Uber should have some kind of hiring standard -- or that passengers should not be rated. I suspect my downgrades are not because of the dogs, but for insisting, as of late, that Uber drivers be professionals -- and that, let me repeat -- THEY WORK FOR ME. I\'m a contractor, and my boss can fire my butt if I don\'t do my job. WIth Uber, you have to pay, no matter how bad it is -- and the good drivers suffer. This is the main issue. It seems to me that good training and oversight could help this situation -- and Uber should sink it\'s bajillion dollars worth of profits into making it a truly superior experience.',
 u"        5/25/2015    2 check-ins        My relationship with Uber is likely to be similar to the one that you had with the stupidly hot guy/girl you dated in college, who looked a lot like a supermodel but had the personality of a brick wall and treated you like dog shit. \xa0You kept coming back for more, even though you weren't sure why.As a technological IDEA, Uber is worth 5 stars.As a technological PRODUCT, Uber is worth -5289 stars.Let me explain.In its perfect form, Uber connects friendly drivers who are looking to make an extra few bucks using their personal vehicles with folks such as yourself, looking for a ride somewhere. \xa0The problems start to arise when individual people get involved (and unfortunately, people do have to get involved).1. Drivers are absolutely not screened properly. \xa0Without exaggeration, I have had 6 drivers inform me about the very lax security standards for Uber. \xa0As a result, you end up with drivers who have committed multiple felonies previously, including driving offenses. \xa0A simple Google search will pull up news stories from across the world describing this issue. \xa0Yes, 80% of Uber drivers are normal human beings. \xa0But what happens when you get into the car with the other 20%? \xa0I have had drivers drive so recklessly that I prayed to Clay Aiken - yes, that bad. \xa0He went up on sidewalks (with people walking there) and everything.2. Drivers are out to make money. \xa0I know that sounds obvious, but hear me out. \xa0Many Uber drivers are now independent business operators (their car is their business) for the first time in their life. \xa0For some, all they know is to try every second to hustle for money. \xa0Your money. \xa0Ask veteran Uber customers how many times they have had rides canceled by the driver just before a surge price started (personally: 3 times, including after a busy concert). \xa0Drivers often have the Uber customer app running on their personal phone to see where surges occur, and will cancel rides on you if they think they can pocket more money elsewhere.So with all of these negative points, why is Uber worth 2 stars, and not 1? \xa0Because there is something admittedly convenient about just ordering a ride with the touch of a button. \xa0And until Uber collapses under the weight of its own gigantic ego (anyone else think that Travis Kalanick probably has a ridiculously tiny penis?), your other option in New York is hailing a street cab and they're not exactly a better option.Surge until your butt hurts...Surge until your butt hurts...",
 u"        8/11/2016    Uber charged my guest 120$ plus tip from Laguardia to the Financial District! When she contacted Uber to file a complaint they offered a 10$ credit. Absolutely numb and in complete denial of the fraud from one of it's drivers. When she replied back saying it was unacceptable Uber cold and calculated response was to cancel her membership. I have never seen such a lack of customer service in the face of clear wrong doing by a driver. You won't have to cancel my subscripton I happily did it myself. Hello LIFT",
 u'        7/29/2016    This was once a great concept and offered great services for reasonable prices not just in the place i live but also in other cities where i visited.However, with the recent re-revisions in base fare every now and then i suspect if this company is now having intents only to profiteer! i mean right in less than 1.5 years the base far has gone up from $5 to $7. I think this re-revision in fares is not a very honest move.Pros--- Drivers are always well behaved and nice. Clean cars.-- Refunds processed on genuine complaints.-- Great concept - with cashless payments, ease of ordering a cabCons:-- Surge pricing is ON more frequently than before.-- Ever rising base fare.',
 u'        7/23/2016    Uber should be banned. They take advantage of people by gouging prices. Local tide should not cost $19. Local car service is $6 for the same ride.',
 u'        12/28/2016    I used to like Uber but recently they hijacked the rates. Also the path they show to reach my destination WTF? Talk about GOUGING. They turn a 5 mile trip into a 12 mile trip. But when they pick you up they actually take the shortest route. This, my friends, is called BAIT and SWITCH and DECEPTIVE PRACTICES. Not too long ago (11-3-16) I took an Uber pool for $11.79. Now the estimated rate is $23.60.',
 u"        12/17/2016    I used Uber all the time until two nights ago; Me, and my Fianc\xe9 went out to Queens NY, and waited for the cab outside in the freezing cold. (10 degrees) we ordered a premium car service ( no car pool).... the guy was so rude, and he stated that he had to pick up 4 more people. Keep in mind it's 3:30 am, we told the guy we didn't order car pool we ordered a regular premium taxi to take us straight home. He refused to take us home, and that's when everything became ugly, not only did we wait for him outside, he didn't want to take us home because we told him we wanted to go directly home. We were extremely tired and just wanted to get home safely. The rude f*ck told us to get out and we told him well that we were charged already and he said we'll call the company & complain ... WELL Sorry to burst your bubble! There is NO phone number to complain to, And to top that off... we were charged with many different fees in our account. Three fees was charged and we can't receive our money back. And it was a pricey penny $50 cab charge that we didn't use, $5 dollars on hold for the uber account and another $8 dollar charge. It's really a shame, I'll never use uber again. The app is officially deleted out of my phone.",
 u"        11/23/2015    I've been a loyal Uber customer for months spending between $200.00 to $300.00 a month on thier service. I've never really had an issue with any ride that wasn't resoled by the company. That was until sunday November 22,2015, since I was running for an appointment I took an uber from Manhatten to Brooklyn. Since I was in a rush I didn't notice that I left my $400 wireless Beats on the back seat. About 5 mintues after getting out of the car I realized I forgot my beats. I tried at lest 30 times to call the drive but he wouldn't pick up he's phone and he had no voice mail set up to leave a message. So I contacted Uber to see if they could get ahold of the driver, but Uber seem unable to get in contact with the driver either. 30 hours later Uber must have gotten in contact with the driver and gave him my phone number. Of course the driver never contacted me and Uber washed their hands of any thing else to do with it. Uber explained that if the driver refused to return my item I would have to file a police report and they would asssit the police with the drivers info. An letting me know that the drivers are contractors and there's nothing else they could do for me. You would think that if a loyal customer spendin $200-$300 a month was robbed by one of their drivers contractor or not. That a company would reimburse or even offer a credit to your account if it was for the full amount. You would think a company would want to show their customer's that they care. An that's why i've deleted my Uber account and signed up with Lyft, I will never use Uber again.",

 u"        5/10/2015    God do I hate Uber's obnoxious pricing. Yes you have nice cars and SUVs and all but your drivers always try to take the long way.

This is how they work so beware!Here's my two latest Uber break downsBase fare-14Distance- 17.85Time- 13.64For a grand total of $45.49 for only 3.79 miles.

Really? \xdcber pricing structure needs to be regulated by our wonderful NYC. Stop taking advantage of New Yorkers Uber!!!",
 u"        10/21/2016    Unfortunately I can't say anything good about Uber. I was charged double price for a 20 minutes trip when there wasn't any high demand for uber and no traffic at all. Instead of paying $35 I had to pay $70 for absolutely no reason. It's much \xa0cheaper to use yellow taxi. The price was shown only after I requested uber and even when I asked the driver how much that might be, he said that should be half price from the one I saw after I requested uber, but at the end I was charged $70. Then I sent an email trying to explain the situation and get $35 refund. They reply to my email without solving the problem, and trying to give me the excuse that was high demand for uber Wednesday night at 12.30 am. I'm really disappointed and I'll never use uber again",
 u"        7/11/2016    Illegal ! To deny a ride because of a service animal is a federal crime.I have a service dog and my friend called uber twice for us and both times the driver pulled up and cxled the ride . \xa0They \xa0both said they wouldn't take my service dog. One was concerned about needing to clean the car after. ( if this is the concern a blanket can be put down ) The third time my friend called \xa0uber and asked them explicitly on the phone we have a service animal with us \xa0and two of your drivers just cxled our ride upon arrival. I am confirming you will take us and they did the same thing confirmed the ride - pulled up and then drove off and refused service. All of the drivers were rude, We were lied to and they illegally refused a ride . Im disgusted and would highly recommend using a company thats workers not only abide by \xa0the law but have some code of ethics \xa0and morals.",
 u'        9/16/2016    Is Travis Kalanick using the pay-day loan industry as a business model? Surge pricing is appalling exploitation. It made the cost of one trip from Manhattan to New Brunswick, New Jersey, 40 percent more expensive. \xa0Aside from that, I\'ve had mostly good experiences with Uber rides within Manhattan and also to New Jersey. The cars were clean and the drivers professional, definitely a huge improvement over Carmel\'s Neanderthals. I like that Uber\'s price is predetermined, so traffic delays don\'t end up costing you a fortune as they can in cabs.On the downside, on two occasions, an Uber driver arrived on the wrong side of the street and I had to cross the intersection (one time at Whole Foods on East 57th Street with heavy grocery bags) to get in the car, but that\'s forgivable given how difficult NYC traffic is to navigate. Once, when I tried UberPool, the app said the car was "arriving now," but after 30 minutes it hadn\'t shown up. I called the driver, who was very sweet and explained she was stuck in a traffic jam on a bridge. I finally canceled and had to pay a $5 fee.One thing I learned the hard way: Just because there are no partitions between the front and back seats and the Uber drivers tend to speak English better than cabbies do, that doesn\'t mean it\'s a good idea to engage them in conversation beyond a polite greeting. I started chatting with one driver and then there was no getting him to shut up -- he started telling me about the juvenile practical jokes he and his coworkers play at his day job, TMI.',
 u"        6/9/2016    DON'T use Uber ever! This is a horrible service. \xa0They completely scammed me and charged me for a ride that was supposed to be taken care of with a code I got from a high end shopping experience. Called customer service and they didn't do anything about it. \xa0Filed credit card fraud against Uber. Called the company I shopped with that uses Uber and they are canceling their services with them as well. Good luck Uber!",
 u'        5/31/2016    Used to love using Uber, \xa0then they started adding ridiculous random charge fees for whatever reason... \xa0Or if your driver is 10 minutes away and you need to cancel you get charged now.. \xa0Its inconvenient. \xa0You also cant avoid pooling with people now and drivers are forced to pick people up and the price is still more expensive than what it used to be for most rides. \xa05 stars for when Uber first started... 1 star for Uber now. \xa0Use Lyft or a regular cab service.',
 u"        11/8/2015    1 check-in        Trying to get a cab In the city for 5 people to go to queens is a mission & a half !!!After the 2nd , 3rd guy refused to take us one of our friends decide to call Uber thank the lord...Cab arrived with in a few minutes basically while we were still trying to get a yellow cab. We all hopped in no problem we had two stops in queens first stop Queens Blvd second stop in Corona no problem. The car was nice , comfy & clean the driver was so nice chi chatting with us along the way. I happen to be the last one to be dropped off had no issues the rest of the ride.I can see why other cab services specially yellow cabs are so against Uber now super convenient , no issues taking u any where no argument nothing I mean dammm that's the way it should be not all the complaining they give specially when going to other boroughs. Cab companies should be afraid of Uber timely arrivals , no arguing with the customers about why u can't take them to their desired destination , friendly service & convenient payment method how can u beat that ... Good experience with Uber I certainly will keep them in mind.",
 u"        9/23/2016            Updated reviewI am taking away a star for the morning Pool experience. Service has gotten much worse in the last couple weeks. \xa0There are 10 minute waits for cars. \xa0Sometimes the app says there are no cars available. \xa0Sometimes a 5 minute wait is indicated and you end up waiting 10 to 15. \xa0They don't let you cancel morning pools without paying a fee, even if you cancel right away because you can tell the time estimate is much too optimistic. \xa0Via and Lyft let you cancel on pools.I still think regular Uber is a great service, but the morning pool service has turned into a bust and we have switched to Via.",
 u"        10/7/2015    I use UBER out of town, and it has always worked beautifully. \xa0In Los Angeles, Boston, Miami, Queens, Brooklyn, etc., I've found them to be highly reliable, reasonable and comfortable. \xa0But in my own neighborhood, Hell's Kitchen, I usually have such a hard time getting a car to show up!In my experience, about 50% of the time, my iPhone would say the ride is coming in several minutes...and it all looks fine, so I'd go downstairs to wait for the car...then BOOM! it's canceled. \xa0Last Friday, it happened twice around 7 PM when I requested a car to go to a friend's place in Washington Heights. \xa0On Sunday, I requested a car to go to LGA--and, once again, the driver unilaterally canceled it.Maybe the drivers cancel when they don't like the destination, they don't like the Hell's Kitchen traffic, etc., but I can't rely on UBER when the service is so unpredictable!",
 u"        11/30/2015    Uber is extremely overpriced in my eyes. I do have some good drivers and I do have some bad ones. And half of them smell pretty bad. I use uber every single week so I believe I have a good representation of the company borough wise. I've compared the prices with my local can companies around my area and they are well off. The the same distance I see atleast a $5 and as much as a $10. This is in multiple locations too.Another big disadvantage with the company is that it's GPS is all off and the drivers do not know how to drop off at multiple locations, and if it's something within the app uber needs to fix that. Especially if you're picking up a big group of people.In addition, if I call/text half of the drivers I get no reply. What's the point of putting in your contact if I can't use it?The company has a great concept and it's extremely convenient. \xa0They really should do a miles system for their loyal customers not just the new ones. Something along the lines of every 100 miles you get a free ride or whatever. I mean uber takes 30% from their drivers, you can afford it.",
 u'        3/25/2015    Ohhhh New York. I love you. Do I love Uber New York? Not really. Is it better than New York Cabs? Yeah, sadly.The reason I love Uber is because I am one of those people who never, ever carries cash. So to be able to get into a car/cab knowing how much it\'s going to cost and get out without worrying about the hassle of a tip is lovely. So I usually love Uber. However-Manhattan prices are nuts. JFK to Manhattan will run you $60. I requested a car at 2:30 am after I had a super late plane come in, and was stunned. I requested Uberpool, which can drop the price significantly, but when nobody else got in the car thought I was screwed out of the fare. Turns out as long as you REQUEST the pool fare they have to honor it even if they don\'t pick anyone else up. It did drop my $65 fare to Lower East to $39. Keep in mind that they charge you for tolls in the fare too.A few days later when it began to snow 2-4" and a good 9,000 people were at Javits for my conference (where there is no convenient subway stop) we also requested another Uberpool. This time 3 of us in my party got into a Prius. The driver then called the next person to pick them up, who told him that there were 2 people in their party. He told them they had to request another car since there wasn\'t enough room. Had that been me, I would have been FURIOUS since it was really cold and snowing, and I already waited for the first car. For the pool option they need to update it so you punch in the amount of passengers in each party. I imagine this happens a lot. The drivers in Manhattan tend to be a bit on the ruder side-I get it, you deal with a crap ton of tourists, and no offense, but a lot of them are foreign and it\'s hard to hear/understand them as well. Buttt, still better (usually) than good old yellow cars. Not always.',
 u"        5/5/2015    I'm aware that Uber is not without issues, but we used it without incident this past weekend to get from the Financial District to the Midwood part of Brooklyn.After a long day of subway adventures and walking (my Fitbit was proud of me by noon), I just didn't feel like dealing with public transit again. \xa0We requested a car to pick us up at our hotel, and the requested vehicle arrived within a few minutes. \xa0We had a bit of a communication mishap about where we needed to get picked up, but that was due to my lack of New York geography knowledge, not the driver's. \xa0He was very courteous, a safe driver, and got us from point A and point B in good time.The phone app told me our car's license plate number and driver's name in advance, which made me feel a bit more secure than many other car services I've been in in New York, and the vehicle smelled better than most other cabs I've been in (in any city). \xa0Payment was incredibly easy and didn't require us to have cash on hand.I'd probably save the money and take public transit most of the time on future trips, but I'd definitely consider Uber a viable alternative.",
 u"        7/31/2016    I have been an Uber supporter for a long time and have lived their service, that is, until tonight. Uber sent me 5 rides for 50 percent off. The first 2 rides were great. But the 3rd ride was double what a normal tax ride would be. WTF?I used the link about the discount and was within the time limit. Their app doesn't allowed w you to contest the charge, so to me, it's useless.Take a regular cab - my advice going forward.",
 u'        7/28/2016    The last 3 rides with the drivers has Been completly incomp\xe9tent and embarrass\xeeng The exp\xe9rience as Been very difficult , Most of the drivers do not Know Manhattan with out GPSAnd can not even find a proper adress',
 u'        2/13/2015    The good:Convenient for when you need a cab and have no cash on hand, which is always my problem. They show you your drivers plate #, name, photo and even put their contact info in case you have to call them. You can also see where they are on the map headed to you.The bad:When I first started using Uber - it was fantastic. Now, I think its completely overrated. The prices are constantly going up, they\'re always on surge times, pick up times are always longer than quoted, and when you\'re in a cab they take extra long routes to rack up on mileage fees.The ugly:Surge: Absolutely ridiculous prices at the weirdest times. A 10 min ride can easily be $40! Defeats the purpose of them being cheaper than a Lincoln or yellow cab. Sometimes it makes more sense to pay the ATM fee and get cash, grab a regular taxi and get home faster.Long routes: Whenever I do have to grab an uber, the second I get in the car I tell them to not use their navigation. If I know where I\'m going I wont even put in my address and direct them. Many drivers have even admitted that the uber navigation goes the longer route and they\'re "not sure why".',
 u'        4/8/2016    I hate this service. Unprofessional and incompetent. Terrible. \xa0Good luck you scumbags.',
 u"        11/21/2015    1 check-in        I've been using the Uber pool lately which is very cost-effective. It beats out yellow taxicab prices any day and truly comes in handy. Super convenient! If you want to give it a try get $15 off your first trip with:miriamw57",
 u'        8/23/2016            Updated reviewSo here is my update.....It turns out that minutes after I wrote this comment, Uber contacted me to let me know that they have reduced the fare. Not bad! I was impressed how fast they tried to work out the situation, and now because of that approach, I will give them another opportunity. Nicely done, Uber!',
 u"        4/20/2016    My uber that picked me up had very poor vehicle quality. I trusted that the Uber I requested to take me to the airport would have basic road safety. We got a flat tire on a major freeway - understandably can happen to anyone. BUT The guy's tires was bare to the rims. All four tires were almost bald! Not wanting to get hit on the freeway in rush hour traffic and now resulting in running late for my flight. I took my luggage out and crossed over a 3 foot median to make my way to safety. The driver tried to tell me he would put on his spare tire and take me to the airport (note the other 3 tires were also in extremely poor shape).For the safety of your partners and riders, Uber requires regular vehicle safety and roadworthy checks. The vehicle inspection is part of Uber's commitment to rider safety. (NOT) (NOT)I have asked \xa0to see copies of this driver's inspection and other safety records. All I was given was a $5 credit which is highly insulting. I have gotten better service and most importantly CONSISTENT service from LYFT.",
 u'        6/27/2016    DON\'T USE UBER! Charged me $55 for an early morning pool ride from Manhattan to EWR. A friend was charged $28 for a pool ride on the same route two days prior. \xa0We could have taken a taxi for the same amount. And did I mention the other riders consisted of four drunk guys on their way back home to Union, NJ after a night in the city? \xa0And I had my 13 year old daughter with me. There were six of us, plus the driver, packed into his SUV. I\'m new to UBER and when a rate of $55 popped up I assumed that would be shared with the other UBER client. Didn\'t realize it was my portion. When I wrote to UBER and explained the situation I was told "the price was clearly given prior to you accepting the ride, so there\'s nothing we can do." Not even an offer of a discount on my next Uber ride, which, because of all of the things listed above, will be never.',
 u"        4/8/2016    If there were zero stars that is what I would give. Was waiting for taxi when Uber rolled up. Having had past good experiences in other cities we got in. I said I had an uber account and he said not necessary. \xa0I trusted he would be the same or less than a cab. \xa0For the same ride downtown that we had taken uptown he charged $35 \xa0for a $20 ride. \xa0Then gave us his card and said to call him direct. \xa0We were so mad we sat at dinner and all of us tore up his card- 4 very mad ex- customers. \xa0Do not have his name so :When in New York BEWARE... If it doesn't go thru your Uber account DON't GET IN.... These free-bird drivers wreck it for all of them . \xa0PS. Every city taxi we got into was amazing, fast and friendly and on a meter.",
 u"        10/10/2015    I used Uber twice. For the same itinerary, at the same time the yellow cab was much cheaper.I don't understand why?",
 u'        3/20/2016    The drivers never actually pick me up at my location, instead often forcing me to cross a dark alleyway or busy intersection bc they are too lazy to find the correct address. They think the address you give them is an estimation not where you need to be picked up. As a woman with a cane, this is especially tiresome.',
 u"        12/20/2015    I was standing on Madison ave and called uber a car pulls up we get in and 4 blocks later the guy tell us to get out he needs to pick up someone else, just then my phone rings and a driver tells me he is waiting for me on fifth ave, and to walk over there, when I tell him what is going on he tells me that he will cancelling me, so we have to get out of the car and on my phone I see I am being charged 10.00 for a cancel fee since I didn't go with that driver called me from Fifth Avenue. I then emailed uber and they give me a Credit on my Uber account automatically. After talking to others I sent an email off to have them cancel my membership and they ask me why after I told them that I will never ride with them again because of the stupid cancel fee that was not my faultPlease note uber has made things right my refunding my money and I am now happy camper",
 u'        11/22/2016    Horrible!! I was charged twice for the same fare, one from my debit card and another from my corporate AMEX. They will not accept responsibility and will not reimburse duplicate charge. They have been a nightmare to contact (must communicate through app). I will never use Uber again!!!! INCOMPETENT!',
 u"        3/20/2016    We are coming from JFK, and Uber app doesn't show any cars around. But when we walk out from the baggage pick up there were maybe 10 Uber drivers waiting !!!!! They were asking for $100 for trip that was $20 going there!! Scams!!Other thing is that they cancel for any reason or just drive away (happen many times), and they charge $10!!! The passenger can't tell their stories can't even put a review.I was charged cancellation fee because the driver didn't even try to put the stroller in his car. They drive away from my husband while he was waiting for them to go to the airport couple do times. They charged my sister cancelation fee and left her waiting in the middle of the night. Because she was on the other side of the street...Great idea but terrible service and execution!",
 u'        11/25/2016    Without question the worst customer service on the planet. \xa0No way to speak to a human, no way to address cheating drivers or overcharges. I will never use Uber again.',
 u"        2/13/2017    This is the worst car service ever. Do not waste your time for the cheap prices. Not only will you go on a tour of New York but the drivers are horrible and you cannot call to complain. No one will get back to you. TODAY I WAS HELD CAPTIVE AND CHARGED FOR IT. I've had 4 heart attacks \xa0diabled with sciatica I use a cane \xa0and i was on my way to cardiac rehab. We realized the address was a little off but still down the road less than a mile. He refused to move \xa0and he refused to give me the car number, (I can hardly see)and I called the cops, \xa0he then pretended not to speak english. \xa0For what would have been a 15 min ride they charged 1.5 hrs, what theives. He arrived at the wrong place picking me up, had me enter from the st side, didn't help with bags either. Then at first wanted to put me off on the expressway and and then had me captive and charged for it... haven't heard from customer service yet. I had a full blown anxiety.attack and could have died, not kidding about that. Uber is not the way to go !",
 u"        3/19/2016    A great conceptual idea with poor execution. They charge you $10 if you cancel outside of 5mins which is the opposite of what I'd expect. I requested an uber and it said he was 2 mins away. I stood in the freezing cold for 18 mins when I decided to cancel DUE TO THE DRIVER not myself and yet I got charged. Seems like I should be able to cancel the arrangement based on the driver not fulfilling the arrangement detailed by the app (time expectancy). I've had many good experiences, but the cancelation policy rubbed me the wrong way and I'd rather pay more for a yellow cab then give my money to this company.",
 u'        10/12/2016    Uber is a total ripoff... There surge pricing practice is outrageous, and a scam. The price your given is a estimate. If there\'s traffic, guess what, your paying more than the estimated price. They say the ETA is 3 minutes, and turns into 15, then you get dropped Then to make matters worse, your charged a cancellation fee of $5.00. They have you walking up to pretty much every black car in NYC, asking, "Uber." and you know the majority of cars in NYC are black. \xa0Drivers have no clue how to navigate in NYC. I mean really, you need to use your GPS to take passengers to a tristate airport. I find yellow NYC taxi cabs know how to navigate NYC much better than UBER, and at a lower price. \xa0UBER, maybe its time to train drivers how to get around NYC. Instead, you sign them up, and \xa0passengers pay the price for their incompetence.',
 u'        3/10/2016    The one star is about Uber\'s mismanagement of a problem, not the riding experience. I used Uber a number of times in NYC and LA with acceptable results. What prompts this review is that I called for a ride and was told "10 minutes" by the app. Twenty minutes later, it said "Arriving soon". Twenty minutes after THAT, the driver cancelled. It suggested I ask for another driver. Except that in the interim the price had gone up 50%. So I had to pay 50% extra to get to my meeting late - something that could have been avoided if I simply had hailed a cab.I contacted Uber to complain and their BIG CONCESSION was that they would not charge me the $10 cancellation fee. Despite having misled me about time, costing me money, and inconveniencing me, there was no thought of, say, giving me a free ride for their mistake. I was supposed to be glad I wasn\'t being charged for the non service! So I wrote back again to point this out. No reply. Nothing. Later, I spoke with a Lyft driver who works for both Lyft and Uber. He said, most likely, my Uber driver had gotten a better call from Lyft which, according to him, gives their drivers a larger slice of the pie. \xa0He said both services systematically lie about wait times so as to not lose fares. Later I spoke to a friend who worked in the office for both. Here\'s what he wrote about Uber:"UBER is an unaccountable, unethical company full of pretentious 23 year old hipsters that uses its drivers like a slave force."This from an insider.',
 u'        8/29/2015    Simply made this page because I thought it would be great for people in New Jersey to talk about their NJ experiences using uber. Me personally, I love it! I regularly take Uber in both Hudson and Bergen County. More than majority of the rides I have taken have been safe, pleasant, prompt and professional. Very rarely do you get the weird uber driver but you find that in any cab company you take. The prices also can\'t be beat compared to other taxis in the area! The company is also very reliable with giving credit back it there is any "problems." Example- a car cancels a ride and charges you for a ride you didn\'t take--this happened only twice within the last year and got refunded on it within just a few hours both times. I also have experienced taking Uber DTS in seaside recently. The prices are a little more and the cabs aren\'t as easy to come by-however it absolutely beats the other cabs and their prices down there by a long shot. Overall, extremely useful! \xa0If your a first time user use my promo code and get $20 off your first ride! Alyssag201',
 u'        10/2/2016    Please be careful with your UBER driver. Last night an UBER driver was supposed to take me home. When I noticed we were going through an unusual route I questioned it and he became very unprofessional, cursing, and screaming. He then stopped the ride and screamed at me to get out of the car. I then found myself at night in the middle of an isolated, unsafe, extremely dark area trying to get another uber. I have never been so scared in my life and have never had this type of behavior from a Yellow cab. I will never use UBER again. Please be very cautious if you decide to use UBER.',
 u'        9/9/2015    I am fast beginning to get annoyed with Uber.This is the company I always go to for taxis in NY however the last three times I have used them they charge far more than the original estimate. \xa0I find this to be unfair. \xa0I booked an uber from midtown \xa0to Brooklyn and was quoted 31 dollars, however the final fare charged was 38! This has happened on a few occasions and there is never any breakdown of what these extra charges are for. The uber drivers themselves in my experience have always very pleasant; knowledgeable of the NY borough, punctual with clean vehicles. Also their customer service response team replies to queries almost in real time, which I find to be very helpful in this day and age where you are queued in a line with an automate email response. I think they need to start giving actuals for fares and not estimates and this would make the service better.',
 u'        4/1/2016    was coming out of JFK and was hit up by a guy who flashed an UBER placard and said I could save $30 with them. He said a driver was right here ready to go so we went outside and there was a vehicle waiting in the passenger pickup zone. He said I could pay cash now $55, or pay with CC. I said I had Uber account and would use that, he said don\'t do that because this is a special discount that wouldn\'t be available if I used the Uber app. Sounded fishy, the car didn\'t have the "U" placard I\'m used to seeing. I asked the driver for ID and made her admit she wasn\'t with Uber. A total scam here, not even sure what really would have happened if I had gotten in the car, maybe even 10 toes up. By the way, it\'s a flat fee $52 by taxi to NYC plus any applicable tolls, total ended up at about $62 to midtown Manhattan. Beware all the scammers here all over the big apple',
 u"        10/2/2016    1 check-in        Fuck uber they made me wait 1 hour \xa0telling me 15 mins 9 mins that's the worst experience I have with a taxi or cab service",
 u'        11/22/2016    Most of the times I\'ve taken Uber, I\'ve had a good experience. They\'re almost always on time, here in Midtown Manhattan I never had to wait long for a ride. There have been some issues, though. Last Saturday, I left the One World Observatory and decided to take the J train at Fulton Street; 25 minutes later I left the station a bit upset because there was no train or an announcement. So Uber was my next choice. The first car showed it would pick me up in 4 minutes: Three minutes later my request had been canceled and there was no explanation for it. I requested the next car: Mr. Abdul, and this was my worst Uber experience ever! The waiting time was 9 minutes, then Mr. Abdul called me, and I answered: "Good evening. Are you my driver?" and his reply in broken English was "I\'m Uber driver, I\'m not your driver." He said the same sentences twice, hung up on me and canceled the trip. I didn\'t have time to react to such an unexpected, insane statement of a driver. The next car I requested arrived in 10 minutes. I reported the problem to Uber, and they replied to me in a professional manner. However, I have to say, most of my rides are very easy, with smart and professional drivers.',
 u'        9/2/2016    They are sometimes horrible. They charged me $97 dollars to go to LGA from the east village. I will never use them again.',
 u"        8/2/2015    I wish there was an option for zero star. The uber car service here in NYC who came to pick us up in an impressive 5 minutes horribly turned us down and refused to take us to our destination. There were 6 of us in my family and when the driver saw my 8 yo niece and another teen in the group, he changed his mind and just texted me with a simple 'so some kids' 'sorry'. How very rude! The worst part is they charged me with $10 automatically deducted on my paypal when we were even refused a ride! I hate this app and hate the service. Will not recommend and I definitely deleting this app.So this is the guy who proudly claimed himself T6 he said if I ever write a review!So this is the guy who proudly claimed himself T6 he said if I ever write a review!",

 u"        10/16/2016    Beware!!! \xa0I was charged more when using an UberPool with two other riders than I've been charged when taking the same route as a solo rider using UberX. \xa0And no, there was no surcharge at either time.",

 u'        11/5/2015    Uber is my preferred method over taxi, for sure. \xa0But you have to be smart about it... you are given the drivers photo, car description and license plate... double check before you enter the car that all match up. \xa0I also love that I can send a family member my route and they can watch on their mobile device the GPS of the car... MUCH safer than taxis. \xa0And, I love the fact that you know how much the ride will be prior to accepting and there is no money exchanged, which always makes me nervous. Overall, I feel much safer in the transparency Uber offers rather than taxis. \xa0I use Uber several times in Chicago, where i am from, so i was excited to try it in NYC when i traveled this summer... overall, great experience and similar to the experience in Chicago, but i did have one bad apple, who just took me on a much longer ride and it cost more than my estimate... I was instantly shown that he took "the long way" and an email to the customer service resulted in an immediate apology and refund.Use my code beth118 and we both win... you get a free ride, up to $15, when you try it and so do I! \xa0Thanks!',

 u'        10/29/2016    I am an uber customer for a long time, and was using Uber services on a regular basis few times a week, always with service satisfaction. This time was totally different: I requested Uber service to take me to east 40th Street in NYC. It turned out to be the most horrible experience ever. The driver, Mr. GHAZANFAR, didn\'t even know how to get on GW Bridge, and started to back off from the bridge when he found out he has to pay a toll, (he didn\'t have an \xa0EAZYPASS), then he missed exit to Manhattan, and took me towards Queens and Albany, when I told him that he missed exit, and what the next exit to take he screamed: " Silent, you \xa0stupid girl!!!", he continuously called me stupid, when I tried to give him directions, yelled at me and said that I give him headache. He was speeding, driving irrationally. I felt threatened and called #911. Operator told that I have to tell him to stop and wait for police, but he wouldn\'t stop.Finally he pulled over next to police car and reported that I gave him aheadache. I got out and hired a yellow cab to complete my trip.This person should not be permitted to drive a service vehicle, he is not a save driver. He can not order a woman to be silent, not in America anyway.I requested my charge for the trip to be credited back to my American Express. My suggestion: it would be beneficial for Uber company to fire this driver before he turns into huge liability for Uber.Does Uber screen their drivers for mental stability and general communication ability?Absolutely terrible experience.Will be very hesitant \xa0in the future to use Uber again .',
 u'        10/9/2016    The driver never showed up.. Took an extra 45 minutes of waiting for Uber then took a Taxi',
 u"        11/26/2014    1 check-in        Uber is awesome. If you've never tried it I recommend you try using it at least once. It's available in most major cities. I've used it in NYC and Philadelphia. The cars are nice and clean. The drivers are polite and well groomed. I love the Uber app. It's so easy to use. You can get free fare estimates, you can split fares, everything you need is on the app. No need to carry cash and no tipping, the fare rate is taken out of your PayPal account from Uber. First time users can usually get a promo code for a free ride so you have nothing to lose. So sit back and enjoy the ride with the Uber experience.That's our Uber driver, Roman.That's our Uber driver, Roman.",
 u'        11/14/2016    Used Uber for the first time last week. \xa0Downloaded the app, requested car service and was told driver was 8 minutes away. \xa0About 7 minutes later, the driver arrived, immaculate car, friendly driver. \xa0About half way home, my cell phone made the "you\'ve only got 5% left" sound and the driver asked if I\'d like to charge my phone for the rest of the drive as he could offer me a power cord. \xa0How nice!!! \xa0Drive was smooth, quick and totally worth the money! \xa0Will definitely Uber again! \xa0I\'m a fan!',
 u"        9/29/2016    Won't use Uber again. \xa0Drivers in NY are overly reliant on GPS and do not know the city. \xa0Recently had a driver pull over on 11th Avenue and he urinated on the street. \xa0In over 30 years of taking taxis and car service in NYC nothing like this has ever happened. \xa0Offensive and crude behavior and I \xa0will not use again.",
 u'        2/16/2016    I called Uber last night in Brooklyn. a man shows up in a private vehicle. no TLC plates or medallion. my coworker asked him where his license was and he gave a story that his car was in the garage. he drove off. completely creepy. anyone can be behind the wheel. make sure to check they have licensed cars and drivers.',
 u"        3/4/2016    The worst customer service ever. Haven't heard back to numerous emails.",
 u"        6/8/2015    WOULD NOT USE AGAIN.My Driver turned a 20 minute cab ride into 1 hour and 20 minute cab ride. He got lost multiple times and even froze at exits to the point we were nearly rear ended multiple times. I asked him not to charge me but he did not know how to navigate the app to do so. I was charged over $100 for what should have costed $20. I am trying to get a hold of anyone on the website for a refund and to report this driver but am getting nothing back. The site is not designed for you to actually receive support as a customer.I was afraid for my well being and was overcharged with no one to assist me. Honestly I'll just yellow cab it from now on. At least those folks know how to drive.This was a very distressing experience.",
 u'        1/26/2016    Uber probably started out with the best intentions. Customer is #1, we\'ve got this really innovative idea, etc. etc. Then they outsourced their customer service center to India. Then profits became more important than service. The end. Paid $10 yesterday to get farther from my destination than I originally started, after waiting 20 minutes for my driver (yet if I had cancelled after 10 minutes, Uber would charge ME a cancellation fee), who\'s car smelled like the inside of a jock strap after an 8 mile run. Thought, "Oh Uber will surely take care of me in this situation b/c come on". Nah, not really. The Customer Service Rep. tried everything, really, but simply cannot grant the refund. My loyalty as a customer was worth about $10. Lyft, Gett, Taxis, but NO UBER!!!',
 u'        9/19/2016    Uber f**k sucks use to love it at first but these drives are rude and us the wrong direction had one driver agrue with me about where i live the gps put her around the corner from my house o told her do a u turn because rhe enternce is on the other side she had an attitude and was huffing and puffing how rude and these other drivers taking trips that are 20 -25 mins away from me makes no sense to me at all. Bacck to lyft',
 u"        12/15/2015    I have been using Uber in NYC for couple of months. Until very recently, service and the drivers I encountered were fine, though I wasn't a fan of the surge pricing. However, yesterday I ended up waiting for over 20 minutes, only had the driver cancelled without my consent. I had texted and called but there was no response, but he had the nerve to charge me $10 for a no-show! After my complaint, Uber issued me a ride credit but I would rather receive a refund. Then this morning, I had issues resetting my password and now my account has been disabled. Emailed uber support hours ago but still haven't heard back. It is super frustrating not being able to call customer service and you are at their mercy whenever there is a problem.",
 u'        2/14/2016    Very poor experience with Uber Pool - surge charge increases the rate of the trip even during the trip - my recent experience in NYC: confirmed uber pool with the app saying "paying $16". After arrival fare was $33. The enquiry with customer service led nowhere. They said $33 was correct. It was %100 more than the original displayed fare. Take a screenshot when confirming uberpool, because the charge might go up..',
 u"        2/25/2016    NYC Uber needs work. Drivers not happy with the new rates where they make less. Plus two drivers canceled during my visit here. One took forever while I'm watching the car get further away on he map. Jumped in a few cabs and was very happy. Don't forget the yellow cabs. Always around",
 u'        10/16/2015    If you know to avoid their over-rate hours (Usually during the weekend), they have an amazing service. I have been using car services and yellow cabs for years, and Uber drivers are all professionals, and all of them have clean cars.The movement of almost everything to the virtual world, it is just natural that we will have the ability to order car service from our smartphone. It is a great service, which really makes getting a private car simpler.Just avoid their over rates, and you will not be surprised with expensive bills.',
 u"        2/23/2015    5 check-ins        Rizwan was like speedy quick once I hit location on my Uber app. He was an excellent driver and not crazy like those Taxi's we've taken before here in NYC. Great conversationist and good service. I will have him pick us up anytime!! =} Reasonable priced for their service and use of his Lincoln car as it was comfy!! Not like those taxi's for their uncomfortable small cars. He has \xa0made me want to be a continuous Uber customer!! Hope my next service is as great as his!!Thanks Rizwan! You're the man!Thanks Rizwan! You're the man!",
 u'        12/4/2015    Corporate greed moneyhoer like to suck money from hardworking slave people its risky to be a driver you lose money driving and downgrading your car',
 u"        12/3/2015    UBER's GPS is completely messed up, and they can't seem to figure out how to pick me up from the front of my building. They always send the car a block away to the back where there's no entrance, which seems like white girl problems except when its raining cats and dogs, and your paying three times as much than a car service. \xa0Then they charged me $10 bucks when the dude couldn't go around the corner and drove away. \xa0The absolute worst. \xa0Combined with their horrible business practices, there's absolutely no reason to use them.",
 u'        9/11/2016    Driver refused to go to my destination. \xa0The. The company charged me $5 for a canceled trip! \xa0A trip that their driver canceled',
 u"        1/4/2016    Using Uber Car Service has been the worst experience ever. \xa0Considering I've used numerous gypsy cabs that should speak volumes. The drivers never know where they're going, take the longest routes. \xa0When requesting a trip the app shows the vehicles route and the estimated time which is never accurate. Then there's the surge pricing. \xa0I had an emergency situation where I requested a ride which normally costs $33. \xa0Unfortunately I accepted a surge pricing which turned a 20 MINUTE RIDE, NORMALLY COSTING $33, INTO $137!!!!!!! \xa0OUTRAGEOUS IS NOT EVEN AN ADEQUATE ENOUGH WORD FOR THIS EXPERIENCE!!",
 u"        8/26/2016    We had nothing but great drivers while we were in the city .. one was not friendly and he barely spoke English but the rest were fluent in English as a second language and kind and funny too!! We had great experiences except for that one and it's cheaper than a cab .. the subway was way too hot for us to use so this worked great ..",
 u'        5/7/2015    Potential for more stars.The first thing that bothered me was that you can\'t really schedule a ride. You just kind of have to take it or not as it can come. Here\'s the story. I gathered the guys at my house for a little pregame before we headed up to the UFC event at Prudential Center. We knew we were taking Uber since Monday and I was bummed then when my buddy told me I couldn\'t just schedule the trip for Saturday at that time. I said to my buddy...."It\'s 2015 can\'t the app just be programmed to create a request for that certain time on that date?" Maybe I\'m asking too much, maybe I\'m spoiled, maybe I just came up with the next step to making Uber a ton more money. Either way it can\'t be done. So here we are Saturday hanging out. We wanted to get to Prudential at 4 and be picked up at 3. So my buddy signs on and starts looking through who is available. at 1:30. everyone is about 15 minutes away sweet. I say "Just ask the driver to leave in 15 minutes" ..."He say\'s No!"...."What?!"...."Now or we take our chances requesting an other ride in about half hour." This is what I do not like about the service. I understand that the long time pain of a taxi is them showing up late, but I can book a taxi the day before or on Monday for Sat \xa0like I initially wanted. \xa0So we accept the ride. The guy who was estimated to be there in 15 minutes. Shows up in literally 5 minutes. Kills the pregame. Now I\'m rushed out the door and annoyed. This is where things get crazy. After we\'re picked up \xa0we\'ve had some drinks and we\'re BS\'ing with the driver. First he takes some way to get to the turnpike I\'ve never even thought of. I say "Hey you\'re going wrong way" He says "No this way is cheaper just a little longer, but you save in tolls." That really annoyed me because I know I saved exactly 90 cents in tolls. There is a reason I don\'t know/go this way. Then the driver went from being part of the conversation to being the only one talking....and turning around to tell the back seat his stories! At one point he pulled the 17 Yr. old with a brand new licence move of turning around and taking the wheel with him. To say we slightly swerved is gracious. I\'d say we veered....and got real nervous. You could hear everyone gasp at the same time. A individual gasping may not be noticeable, but 5 people at once is very. He noticed the error of his ways and made an effort to keep his eyes forward for the next little bit. However, that only lasted so long. He began story telling again at a red light and my friend in the passenger seat had to notify him the light turned green and cars were honking. \xa0Aside from the technical flaws of the driving the driver made a pretty crazy remark to my friend. After we Swerved/Veered my buddy said "Whoa guy there\'s plenty of weight in this car with 5 adult men maybe you\'re not used to driving with the weight"" \xa0referencing that we just made a pretty big swerve and he could have lost control of the car. The driver proceeded to turn around and say "Hey maybe if you lost about 200lbs". That\'s crazy. I know my buddy made a comment first and I\'m not saying the driver needs to take abuse; I\'m saying that in the end he was driving like crap and something needed to be said. My buddy got pissed. )He\'s a former big guy who works hard to stay on the smaller side.) He said "Hey I\'m 230 You know what I would look like if I lost 200Lbs?!" and the driver says "I used to be fat too until I started exercising." That\'s messed up. Essentially he just called him fat again. This started out as a 3 Star review but upon reflection of the evenings events I\'m knocking it down to 2.Of yeah Uber is cheap mid day to get you somewhere. The fee was tripled to get home at 10:30pm. A random Taxi service outside Prudential was 40$ Cheaper.',
 u'        12/17/2015    So, so disappointed in Uber, and I hope they read this. \xa0I was an early adopter, use them whenever possible, and have had very few issues. \xa0I went to LGA from the UWS earlier this week - the driver proposed going a longer way from my apartment, then didn\'t follow the route I requested, then when I got to the airport, he did not take me to Terminal A, even though I told him THREE times - because it is a different exit, and closer to NYC. \xa0He got lost driving around LGA, and didn\'t turn off his meter - charged me the full fare. \xa0I\'ve emailed Uber 3 times - the last response from customer service was that yes, he got a little lost, but the fare was still in \'the estimate\' of what it should be so "no worries" (yes, the person actually wrote that) and no reduction for the extra ride around (and around) the airport, not to mention the stress of making my flight. \xa0In fairness, they offered me $10 off my next ride, but that doesn\'t really help, as this was a business trip, and the next (if there is one) may be for personal use - two different credit cards. \xa0Awful driver, lax customer service. \xa0Sadly, I\'ll probably still use them, as sometimes it just works better thant hailing a cab. \xa0Wish there was a better alternerative. \xa0UBER: I have loved you for so long - I\'m at a loss.',
 u'        2/12/2016    I\'ve used Uber twice and it was cool. No long distance just in my area for errands. So today my friend and her son came to visit and I offered to Uber her home because it is currently freezing. Her ride was suppose to be on average $10 when I checked on her to see if arrived safely my receipt said $30.92 I was baffled. When I realized that the Uber drive claimed he took my friend to Williamsburg. I called her like "Where are you?" She said "Home putting the baby to sleep" my mouth was wide open in disbelief. I sent them an email, oh wait. When I called the driver her hung up on me twice and then when I tried a third time he said call uber. Uber\' customer service sucks. It is poor and horrible and disgusting. Guess I\'ll just wait for an email.',
 u"        11/9/2015    Does Uber actually have an algorithm for traffic!?!? I thought they just use google traffic which is pretty accurate. But that can't be the case bc a uber seems to have a love for taking the FDR regardless of traffic/distance. The last two times I've called an Uber they've taken the FDR and in both instances it as a terrible choice. First time was at 1am when there was no traffic on local streets but the FDR had horrible awful traffic bc there was construction and only one lane was open. The second time I was visiting a friend who lives on 126th on the westside and I was coming from 59th and Lex. This time the FDR wasn't backed up but the 125th exit was closed, so we had to exit at 135th and drive back down. That's almost 20 extra blocks of unnecessary driving. Ugh...",
 u"        7/27/2016    I wish I could give zero stars. \xa0 This is not a complaint about the service, but rather the billing. \xa0Yesterday I took a POOL Share ride, which is advertised as flat $5 fee in Manhattan during 7am-10am weekdays. \xa0They charged me $68.97 going from East 85 th Street to East 14th street. \xa0There were three other riders in the car with me, so it was clearly a pool share ride.I emailed their customer service which insisted that their dopey surge pricing was in effect. \xa0This clearly contradicts both my receipt and their web site which both say that surge pricing is never applied to share rides. \xa0There is no way to speak with a real person. \xa0Their customer service and software are both pathetic. \xa0Uber has gotten way too big for their britches and they've become arrogant, with a big decrease in customer service. \xa0My experiences with VIA have been much better, and that's why, I suspect, that so many drivers are quitting Uber. \xa0They got too big too fast and dont know what they're doing. \xa0I'm stuck with this bill and i don't think I have any recourse.YELP: \xa0Allow users to give no stars.",
 u"        12/7/2015    I was quoted an estimate of $35-$42 for a ride from LGA to Gramercy Tavern on Thursday evening at 7:45pm. When my phone alerted me during dinner that I had a new email from Uber I was SHOCKED to see $85.58.For the ride back to the airport on Sunday I called a car service and was quoted an estimate of $40. When I got to the airport the cost was $40 just like they said. I will definitely take a car service over Uber any day. WINTHROP CAR & LIMO SERVICE ARE AMAZING! Next time you travel to NYC be sure to call them for a ride 1 (718) 209-1111. You won't be disappointed with them the way I was with Uber.",
 u"        5/2/2015    Oh my fucking god. Was told multiple time, first over the phone then in the car, that my ride wouldn't be more than $50-60. I look at my bank statement and THEY CHARGED MY A WHOPPING $112!!!!! I'm never using Uber again, my ass",
 u"        1/15/2015    I've been using UBER for a bit over 3 months to commute home when I work late. This is from Brooklyn to New Jersey and the drivers do a great job, are quick and polite.Unfortunately the UBER system may has some glitches calculating miles when it loses GPS connectivity. This happened to me 4 times (out of the 16) where the receipt displays up to 4 miles over the usual 22 miles. The receipt provided by UBER shows a map with the route. On these days the map shows the car returning to the start and then on a straight line crossing the Hudson River south of the Holland Tunnel.The support is not consistent. They are quick on the first response, but (on my case) took up to 12 days to respond when I contested the first response. This while I keep sending emails (they don't offer phone support) asking for updates. UBER acknowledged a GPS issue on two of the cases, but refuse to acknowledge on the other two.I still use UBER since as I said first the drivers do a great job, but I keep wondering if this problem only happens to me.Receipt map showing incorrect route. The actual route went from Canal ST to the Holland Tunnel without returning to Brooklyn.Receipt map showing incorrect route. The actual route went from Canal ST to the Holland Tunnel without returning to Brooklyn.",
 u"        11/1/2015    At the beginning, uber was very convenient for me because it's hard to get a cab at my neighborhood. However, the uber drivers were playing this trick lately which they don't come pick you up and wait for you to cancel because you are in hurry so they can get the cancelation charge fee. It happened to me twice. The first time, the driver even called me saying he can't come pick up at my location. The second time, the driver just ignored my calls and texts. I wrote to uber and yep no responds. I paid for no service or negative service. My advice, if you see the uber driver is not moving in the direction to you or it takes more than 30 seconds to start moving, cancel it right the way before the 5 min because you not gonna get it.",
 u"        4/21/2015    If I could give negative stars I would.We took an Uber from Hoboken to Soho.Our driver wasn't following his GPS or my directions. \xa0Which resulted going in circles in Manhattan traffic.After he dropped us off, he apologized for not being able to speak English...UHHHHShouldn't that be a criteria?Or be able to follow a GPSOr know the neighborhoods where you don't have to rely on a GPS or customers giving directions.Never again.",
 u'        3/29/2015    Uber has decided they don\'t give a damn about their customers because they have absolutely no customer service reachable by telephone. With that many customers, there should be a better customer servicing system in place. After my first and only ride, I decided I hated Uber and wanted my account deleted. I emailed the issue to them and received a reply surprisingly quickly. \xa0When I said I wanted to delete the account - all of a sudden, the responses stopped coming. \xa0When they finally did reply, it was only to clear up my account by asking me to send over pictures of my ID and any credit cards I have on the account. Excuse me. \xa0I am not looking to "clear up" my account. I want it deleted. \xa0Don\'t ask me again if I want to keep it. I will never use Uber again. I don\'t care how many customers you have. \xa0This is one person who absolutely abhors your entire system. There are plenty of other options that don\'t keep disabling my credit cards whenever I\'m about to book a damn ride. Before I even took my FIRST RIDE, I already had my account disabled without notification. I\'m done wasting my time. Get better developers. Be more innovative. Because your application needs a lot of help. And your lack of customer service is horrendously awful for such an overrated company.',
 u"        6/10/2016    I'm done with uber! The surge pricing is simply robbery. I usually don't use uber during surge pricing. But I had no choice one recent night when I was traveling from riverdale in the Bronx, back to Manhattan in a monsoon rain storm. The ride ended up costing $150. My bad for not getting the free estimate which I normally do, but it was pouring and we were trying to get going quickly. Besides clogging up all of NYC traffic with the amount of uber cars, I've had it with the gouging. Never again, Uber. Buh-bye.",
 u"        8/27/2015    I have been a big fan of UBER for a while now. Everytime and I mean EVERY SINGLE TIME, my Uber driver has been extremely courteous and friendly and their cars are extremely clean. More times than not I've been offered water, candy and a phone charger to use for the duration of the trip. While occasionally during peak hours Uber can get a little pricey, in my opinion you get what you pay for.While I personally have never had a bad experience, I have heard occasionally from my friends that an Uber driver had purposefully take a longer route just to rip them off. That being said when my friends contacted Uber and told them what happened their trips were refunded in full immediately. Furthermore, there is a 5 star rating system for Uber drivers (sound familiar) such that over time the bad ones will get weeded out. These guys have revolutionized the taxi service and I like knowing that wherever I go out in the city, I know I will always be able to catch a cab home.",
 u"        3/17/2015    $48.00 for a 10-minute ride SIX BLOCKS across mid town in the afternoon! If our progressive Mayor De Blasio wants to do something to STOP UBER from heaping on their SURGE PRICING I will be a happy New Yorker.  \xa0 \xa0In my opinion PIGGY PIGGY PIGGY EVIL UBER needs to be regulated.  \xa0 \xa0Maybe there is a wonderful class action case hiding in there. I see their chief financial officer abandoned ship.  \xa0 \xa0I wouldn't use uber unless they paid me to take the ride... and I would charge SURGE PRICING,.Hate 'em.",
 u'        3/23/2015    Never used the service before, but last night as I was trying to hail a cab at 11PM in Manhattan an uber limo pulled up to pick me up. I asked if he would take credit cards, he said yes, and I got in - it was very chilly out! I told him my destination and he asked "is 50 good for you? "I did not expect that, and he said: how much do you want to pay? I said I never paid more than 25 for that ride in a cab, he stepped on the brake and yelled "get out!" Wish I had the license #!!this was my first and last uber experience!',
 u"        7/11/2016    VERY DISAPPOINTED! driver took me from west 13th in a city and brought to Brighton Beach in Brooklyn for $117!!! usually its about $50-60! But when i opened my history i saw cancellation fee $5.00 and road trip to Ozone Park through Brighton Beach! How to understand that???? Guys just making money on people who doesn't check the pricing and trip history!! never will use again and will never to recon to no-one!!!",
 u"        11/10/2015    Okay. They do not know their routes. They kept circling around and the final price went over the price range. They started to ask us how to get there. I think that's your job. I even told him the address. Plus the estimate price range is so useless because it will charge you the highest amount or more. So disappointing. Better off taking the yellow cab.",
 u"        12/29/2015    This review is for the poor customer service I received after my ride. \xa0They claim the first ride you take is free, up to a maximum of $20.00. \xa0 But they charge your credit card for the full amount, and when you get in touch with them, you get the runaround. \xa0I have emailed customer service six times already, and they have a million different excuses for not helping me. \xa0 The email address is unfamiliar to them (ridiculous), they can't identify the account holder, so on and so on. \xa0 They claim that they are. Or allowed to discuss the account with anyone but the account holder, but when you say you are the account holder, they do not respond. \xa0To summarize, the poor customer service and their inflated prices are reason enough to go elsewhere. \xa0 Be warned about their free offers and money back. \xa0Just try to get it!",
 u'        10/18/2015    Had my first experience with Uber last night, and it was definitely not pleasant. \xa0My husband, friends and I had just exited the Mets game (on a freezing cold night, I might add) and called for a car. \xa0A supposedly three-minute wait for the car turned into a 30-minute wait and search for him since he never made it to us. \xa0We finally found him under an overpass near the GCP after he screwed up getting to us. Going to game again tonight and will be be getting there and back on the subway! \xa0Get your act together Uber.',
 u'        11/19/2014    My first experience with Uber was great! I registered only a few days before our trip and loaded a "$30 off your first ride" coupon.I checked the estimation of cost before requesting a car and agreed to the 1.4 increase based on the traffic @ 6pm on a weeknight in Midtown and we headed down to meet our driver in front of a hotel.My only qualm was that the app was showing our driver\'s car going back and forth, twisting around, and continuously said "6 minutes away" for about 10 minutes. I finally called the driver and he let us know he was 1-2 minutes away and sure enough he was. Having the driver\'s picture, car picture and license plate number is incredibly useful as we were standing in front of a high-end hotel where there were identical and multiple black SUVs pulling up to drop off guests. The driver was very pleasant and did his best to get us to our dinner reservation on time, which he did. Payment was easy ($6 after the $30 off coupon!) and couldn\'t have been better.',
 u"        7/25/2016    Call for a car on 7/17/16 @ 3am. The driver never showed up, my PayPal was charged $22.87. I tried calling to dispute, the recording kept directing me to go online. I went online and nothing. \xa0I'm never using uber again, I'll take my chances with regular cabs. Uber are crooks. BEWARE!!!!! \xa0I couldn't post without giving a star rating, \xa0I'm forced to give 1 star. When actually it's zero stars!",
 u'        6/7/2016    I have been using Uber for a long time (at least twice a week) and with a few exceptions have been very happy with their service but I am so ticked off at their "customer service" right now I have steam coming out of my ears. Last night I needed to return an item and pick up a replacement that was only being held for me until 9:00 pm, so I went on the App to get an UberX. \xa0I got an error message that said something along the lines of my payment method was invalid. \xa0It\'s the same card that\'s \xa0been on my account for at least a year, so I\'m going "what?" and I try again. \xa0Same thing. \xa0So I log in to my cc online. \xa0Nothing is wrong. Bill is paid in full couple of weeks ago, high credit line, and the only charges on the card are my Uber rides from the past couple of weeks and a Starbucks. So I try again. Same thing. I\'m like WTH is wrong??? \xa0So I call my card issuer and tell them I am trying to get an Uber and they are saying my card is "invalid". \xa0My card issuer tells me that NOTHING has been presented for authorization on my card in over 24 hours, and those happen to be the two Uber rides I took the day before. I tell the cs rep I tried three times so that should have shown and she says, no, nothing. \xa0So I try again with her on the phone and I get the same error message from Uber, that my payment method is "invalid". She again sees nothing on her end. \xa0End call.So I log in to the Uber App on my phone and online to see if I can see anything wrong. \xa0I re-enter my zip code, exp date, security code, etc. \xa0Try again. \xa0Same thing. \xa0Send a message on Facebook. Look all over the website. \xa0Request their phone number. Delete my main payment method. Try to use my back-up payment method. \xa0Same thing happens. \xa0Log into the account that is linked to. \xa0No problems there either. WTH is going on? I\'m running out of time to exchange my item and the store is only holding it until 9:00 .... Something is clearly wrong. Try to delete my back-up payment method. Doesn\'t work. \xa0So I end up having to put another card entirely on my account, which I really don\'t like doing because I use one card for online shopping, one card for apps and under $10 safe purchases (Starbucks, etc), one card for sketchy places that could have skimmers or where I have to hand my card off to someone, one card for travel, etc. So when I wake up this morning, their cs has messaged me back on FB and I\'m thinking, well, it\'s about half a day too late but maybe I\'m not the only person who had this problem after installing the update so maybe they are swamped. \xa0Anyway, the bottom line is I ended up getting a generic link to "how to add a payment method to your account". \xa0Uh, that\'s not the problem. \xa0The problem is that I was getting a payment method is invalid message for a valid payment method, and it was a day or so after installing the update. \xa0I want this fixed because I don\'t want to be out somewhere with just my phone and need to get an Uber and have the same thing happen, except this time I\'m not at home with access to a pile of cc\'s.Update: \xa0Have given up on customer service completely. \xa0They sent me a message saying it looks like I deleted my payment method and added another. \xa0Uh yeah, that\'s what I said I did, after getting the same "invalid payment method" error message about 15 times and having my cc issuer and bank tell me nothing was wrong. \xa0How else was I supposed to get an Uber before the store closed? Click my heels three times and wish? \xa0Use your common sense mister. Still doesn\'t solve the problem of how two valid payment methods give an invalid message after an app update.',
 u"        10/6/2015    F**K UBER. I used it for the first time going to LaGuardia and they added a SURGE CHARGE. Firs time user here and in a hurry to get to the airport and didn't have time to explore the APP. Basically they charged me DOUBLE. I WILL NEVER EVER USE THEM AGAIN.",
 u"        2/4/2015    Absolutely abysmal customer service. \xa0I've had non-stop problems with the app and accessing my account online. \xa0I've tried emailing their support and received no response. \xa0How the hell does Uber not have a customer service phone number? \xa0That is ridiculous given how error-prone their app is.Also, I've been receiving texts from various numbers with spam from Uber since I signed up. \xa0Just terrible.",
 u"        4/9/2015    1 check-in        I have used Uber extensively in big cities like NYC and in small towns in Virginia. It has never disappointed me. I'm telling you, in NYC it is the way to go, the wait is often 2 minutes or less and the user experience and app are so much more robust than GETT and Lyft.I used to fly 100k miles or more a year in 50 cities a year. I wish Uber had been around when I was a road warrior.It's really, really good. I'm a fan!",
 u"        3/9/2015    It's an evil thing they do. They manipulate the transportation market and we're the pawns.I summoned a car, car shows up, won't take me with a small pug dog. Fine, I summon another from Queens to NYC and pay $91.They charge ME a cancel fee of $5 when they canceled. I will dispute that with Amex and win, but what balllllzOnly in an emergency would I use them again, just on principle. Unsavory.",
 u"        12/22/2015    Waited for 25 minutes, but Uber didn't show up. Really inconvenienced us. Do not recommend.",
 u'        7/10/2016    The app super easy to use. \xa0The cars are dirty and smell pretty bad. \xa0My sister forgot one is his articles. The driver would not return them. \xa0Have contacted uber. \xa0They recommend contacting the driver who is 167 miles away now. \xa0Thieves.',
 u'        2/11/2015    1 check-in        Far worse over the past year... pick ups take forever.. tons of taxis why do I have to wait for 10 min when there was a car a block away?',
 u"        7/9/2015    Uber app in New York is very temperamental \xa0 Don't rely on current location for an accurate \xa0pick up location. Once you request a ride call the driver to confirm the pick up and drop off locationHop stop is a GREAT app for navigating the city subway sustem",
 u'        5/16/2016    Great technology but these people have PhDs in ripping customers and drivers off. I strongly recommend VIA (shared taxi), Gett, and Lyft. I cant imagine how much more rude these guys would be without competition. This could be a Harvard Business School case of how a badly mismanaged company (coupled with terrible customer service) can undo the benefits of a great technology. I am glad that I am not the only one giving this company a one star. Wake up, Uber!',
 u"        2/22/2015    Good if your stuck in a jam and maybe if your a girl that wants to get off the street late at night \xa0& prefer to get your credit card rapped by a Company that charges you a ridiculous price at the end of your ride... Like I was! $114 for a 23 minute ride! UNREAL!! If you get an UBER X btw only God knows who will come get ya.. I've tried that .. No Bueno Go with the black option at least the drivers & cars seem better .. If your going to give this a shot??GL!!",
 u'        3/30/2015    I have been using UBER for 2 years so I have seen the evolution. I have now taken them enough that I have gotten "VIP\' status. \xa0When you ride BLACK you get great service consistently. When you ride X, its a craps shoot. TRY ALSO GETT & LYFT. Then you have choices. The advantage of Uber is that you have control over the level of service. You can go luxury, luxury SUV or low end and even share a ride to make it even more low cost. \xa0Here\'s the deal:UberX is sketchy. You never know what you are going to get when you order UberX. And that is the way it is when you go cheap. You get what you pay for. Former yellow cab drivers. Now I believe everyone is entitled to make a decent living so I do not have a problem with their previous job. The issue becomes that the drivers continue the taxi driver attitude which means they can be less than friendly with the bobbing and weaving driving style and a car that is not so well kept. Low barrier to entry for UberX drivers as any type of car goes as long as it is not older than (I believe) 5 years old. Surge pricing on UberX has gotten me caught in the rain UNTIL I REALIZED......UberBLACK is the way to go for those who would like a quality ride with customer service. Again, you get what you pay for. A nice driver in a nice car who offers water, mints and tissues and opens the door for you to enter and exit plu pleasant conversation. The drivers of the luxury cars are usually more educated and business-minded. It more than just their quick way of making money and they realize that it is customer service that clients enjoy and pay for. Here is the key for UberX folks, when there is surge pricing with UberX which is practically always when you want to get somewhere during AM or PM rush hour, UberBLACK is LESS expensive then taking UberX. Now isn\'t it nice to get out of the rain during rush hour into a beautiful Mercedes-Benz, Suburban or Lincoln MKT with a nice driver?Now what is this VIP status? When you have completed a certain number of rides (I believe it is 100 -Uber watches everybody with their God View and any savvy company knows its clients VERY WELL so I am sure they watch me even when I am in another country and not using them-but so does the US government-there is no such thing as privacy so do not delude yourself), you are a VIP. This status allows you to order preferentially the highest rated drivers for you trips. I AM WAITING FOR MY LOYALTY DISCOUNT which is why the VIP status has done really nothing except make me realize I must use some of the other car services more.Use the FARE ESTIMATOR. I see anger all over the place about people feeling gouged. Determine ahead of time with the estimator what you will pay and then you will have no unpleasant surprises.Time until the car gets to you? Those are not very accurate. I presume that is because the Google map system is not properly calibrated for places like Manhattan with all the lights, one way streets and highly variable and changing traffic conditions. But you can see where your assigned driver is and you can call them from the app.The rating system-I give 5 stars to the driver unless they do something really wrong. I know that Uber deactivates drivers with low rating and that means that you do not see any rating lower than like 4.2. Not sure how dependable these rating are because its like all or nothing. I know if I give a 4 I am affecting the livelihood of that person and many times the low rating are for something out of the driver\'s control. If you leave late and then there is traffic, you are mad when you miss your appointment or plane and then you take it out on the driver and give them a 2,3 or 4? Not fair.Tips-Uber discourages this because there is no way to give tips on the app. I supposed you can give cash, but for those of us who do not carry much cash, its inconvenient. I have had drivers I would like to tip. If I have a great UberX driver, he or she deserves a little more than the piddly amount they get from Uber. And for UberBLACK drivers, those drivers that are entrepreneurs and figure out a way to make me feel just a little more special? They deserve a gratuity.When I first started 2 years ago, the quality of the cars and drivers was consistently better. That was when there were not the different levels of service. Now with all the levels of service, if you order UberBLACK or higher , you are good albeit at an increased out of pocket. UberX and Ubershare? You are not quite sure what you are going to get and that is how it is when you go on the cheap with anything. That is the trade off.No phone customer service? That is irritating. I lost something in one of the cars and realized it 5 minutes after I got out. It took me over 24 hours to get it back. Uber was in contact with me by email but that is just not good enough. As a business owner, I know that it is not all that expensive to contract with a live answering service.',
 u'        9/26/2015    UBER is definitely not there to replace taxi! And UBER drivers will be likely the ones who will bring it down. I really think taxi companies have little to fear as long as they are honest and reasonable. In my view UBER is here to re-calibrate taxi services and put them in check. Once this function is done and taxis switch to locator apps and more friendly service, UBER will be no longer needed. For rides from any airport I would strongly recommend to avoid UBER. I also read this between the lines of many UBER reviews. UBER driver will always try to overcharge, no matter what - this is nature of their business. They have no reputation to protect. Taxi cabs will protect their reputation, just like any company would. UBER is not a company - it is just an app written by some guy with his friend and people are just using it. While UBER may be good for some rides, and especially for local rides, e.g. teenagers returning from high school football practice, occasional grocery trips when your car is in mechanic shop, etc. I plan to keep UBER as last resort for any serious trip.',
 u"        9/14/2015    I don't get it. \xa0I presume if you need a ride and no taxis are available Uber makes sense. However last evening my wife and I needed to go from 97th St on the West side of Manhattan to 77th St and York on the East side. \xa0Good time to try Uber. \xa0Using the app the estimate was $23-25 which sounded awfully high. \xa0We hailed a cab in a minute or two and the cost was $13 including tip. \xa0Tell me again about why I should use Uber?",
 u"        9/26/2015    Works when it works. A waste of money the rest of the time.I just wrapped up an unspeakably ridiculous hour-long Uber ride home. I live 20 minutes from my starting location, but it took me an hour to get home. Something is wrong. Aside from the fact that surge pricing made my trip twice the amount it should be, it also took me 40 extra minutes to get home. What the ... ?I think that the Uberpool feature is probably great if you're going short distances. But due to numerous cancellations, my driver took me in circles for 20 minutes before even picking up my carpool mate. I finally had to ask him what the hell he was doing.When my carpool share finally got in, all was great. Until I realized that we had wasted 20 minutes circling the block, took 15 minutes to get her to her destination, and were now in the thick of traffic in Union Square. Car to car, wall to wall traffic. And with surge pricing, I was being charged double to sit still.Fuck Uber. I will take the fucking train. I'll brave the smelly guy in rags, the loud, oblivious pre-30's whoeverthefuck's idiotic conversations. But I will never be taken for fool again. Fuck Uber. Bitches.",
 u'        4/9/2015    Uber is fine for long distances, but more expensive and inconvenient for short trips, ESPECIALLY IN NYC.While the cars are generally cleaner than yellow cabs, I have stopped using uber in New York. The drivers will accept a request and then not show up so that they can charge you without doing anything. One guy wanted me to walk 5 blocks to him and I was charged $10 when I had to cancel and order another car. That "2 mins away" car will take 10 minutes to arrive. It also costs more to get to the airport.One more thing: while I like that the route is mapped out, it is almost always longer and slower than necessary and the drivers will not deviate.',
 u"        5/2/2016    I've been a loyal customer since their early days but it's really quite shocking how drastically uber has declined. Drivers are very often late, rude and really just don't seem to care. I will be switching over to Lyft or another competitor. I didn't want to have to switch, but numerous poor experiences have forced my hand. It's a shame, back in the day uber was untouchable. Now you're shockingly better off taking a taxi.",
 u'        6/2/2016    DO NOT USE UBER. they are a ripoff!! The driver charged me $140 from JFK to Manhattan. \xa0Complete ripoff. Quoted me 90 then added 50. Will be reporting',
 u"        1/4/2015            Updated reviewI just got a response from Uber and thought that they are humans there but used them again today and got a fraudster.. They charged double of what this trip is supposed to cost.. This guy drove in circles used our gps to find a way after 30 minutes, didn't disconnect his meter and charged me $75 after more than hour driving?? Are you kidding me.. If you want to investigate its DANACH B02764 January 4th 10pm from upper east side to brooklyn. Normally $35-40 max and takes 25 mins.",
 u"        4/23/2015    It's just meh... The car was dirty, the driver barely spoke english but he showed up very quickly.I don't think I will be using their Black Car service again.",
 u"        11/20/2015    They over charge you wherever they can and don't pick you up on time. Don't take an uber if you want a reasonably priced and efficient car service.",
 u'        5/30/2015    Another successful Uber ride. UWS to Port Authority. \xa0Such a pleasant & helpful driver, hoisting my 50-lb bag into trunk. Love the positive vibe the Uber drivers bring to each ride request!',
 u"        11/5/2014    In response to the comment from Uber management \xa0: No, the price did not load, as it showed it was an error. I am 100% sure of that, as I saw it. With my eyes. The ones in my head. And let me tell you, if I know one thing about the way my time is spent, those eyes sure could read. So I'll repeat : There was no price given due to a loading error. But hey, desparate people want to get home right? \xa0I figured , hey, surge pricing can only cost me double, so $80 would be OK, since the ride was taken before. \xa0Nope. $226. Guy, people are *crowd-funding* their Uber rides that they got ripped off on. It's not just me; search Uber in Google News and BAM! Your company has this rip-off thing down tight; no help was offerred, like I said in my review.. It's a great freakin' scam, I'll tell you this much. Definitely worth a slow clap. I never thought I'd say this based on my excitement when Uber first came, but I truly, madly, deeply hope the local government gets its boot brown with the kick in the behind they give your company on the way out. --------$226 for a 40 minute ride from midtown to Brooklyn that normally costs $40 according to Uber's own price quote or $30 with a traditional car hire. Unbelievably disgusting business practice, and if you do your research you will find that Uber or it's drivers (does it matter who does it?) pulls this rather routinely to customers. \xa0Stay away unless you absolutely don't care what you get charged. If you really need a car, have a few handy car service numbers saved on the days where yellow cabs are hard to come by. But Uber is a poor choice. What a silly company. To get a few hundred bucks and lose inevitable thousands in the future. I think they know that their time in New York is limited so this is why they are resorting to despicable scamming. If you are one of the unlucky ones to get overcharged, there is no getting your money back. PayPal will not have your back on this. There's nothing really else to say regarding this, thus pardon my short review.Be wary and I'd highly recommend you avoid at all costs. i'm hearing more and more stories like these from my friends, although not nearly as bad. Just yesterday a friend was hit with $150 for the SAME ride I paid $27 for with a traditional car service based in Brooklyn (won't say the name as I think it may violate Yelp policy. But there are MANY decent ones)Uber : the biggest scam on New Yorkers this year. But at least they made it slick and user friendly. Which I guess makes sense. If you're gonna screw us, at least take us out to dinner, right?",
 u"        11/19/2015    Uber is great but don't do the price surge. It's a ripoff. Every time it rains price doubles or tripled. They say because demand is high not enough cars available. That's bull when I used it twice I had a car in a minute. I hope nyc goes after them it's gouging. I will never do price surge again ever. Also drivers always say it's slow.",
 u'        5/2/2016    What a horrible company. \xa0I got the iphone app, created an account with my American Express card and signed in. \xa0I used the exact password I used to create an account. \xa0I tried 10 times (at least) and it kept saying "sign-in failed." \xa0It kept asking if I wanted to reset my password. I finally said yes (also 10 times) and it kept saying an email was sent to reset. \xa0IT IS NOW OVER AN HOUR AND I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE ANY EMAIL. \xa0I GOOGLED THEIR PHONE NUMBER TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND I COULDN\'T FIND ONE NUMBER THAT HAD A LIVE PERSON; EACH ONE WAS A RECORDING. \xa0 I live in NYC and have never seen such insanity. \xa0I GAVE UP. \xa0Obviously they are a horror. \xa0Use Lyft as I will.',
 u"        1/24/2015                Listed in TransportationI took my first Uber yesterday--I could say I popped my Uber cherry, but that's tacky--and there were lots of things I liked about it, especially compared to yellow cabs. I'm the kind of person who takes the train to JFK--I have an unlimited MetroCard--so I'm not a habitual cab-rider.I don't know how the cost compared to what a yellow cab would have charged me, but since I compulsively watch the meter when I take a cab, I missed not being able to see the dollars and cents adding up while riding. On the other hand, it's great to be able to see the trip progressing on the screen of my smartphone, and it's totally awesome that the driver has a map of the trip in front of him; I can't tell you how many drivers over the years a) refused to follow my directions b) couldn't understand English, or c) were completely clueless and went in circles until I ordered them to stop the meter. (True story.)I like that you can communicate with your driver before he picks you up, and that you don't have to wave like a maniac to be picked up. It's good to have this other option, and I'm pretty sure I paid more because I had to get the Uber at rush hour on a Friday; I'll pay attention to future rides to see how they go. And the tip (20%) is included. That's something I always made sure to calculate, and it would be nice to be able to withhold the tip for a totally sh!tty driver, but in the case of this first ride, I was totally happy with the driver I got. I'll do it again, but it might not be my first choice.",
 u"        11/16/2014    I signed up with a $20 off your first ride coupon and they didn't take it off my first ride. Instead, I paid full price.Shortly after my first ride, I saw the receipt in my email. Then, I got an email promising me $30 off rides if I refer friends.. Not sure why I would even believe this since my sign up coupon wasn't applied. If you overcharge on my first ride, not sure why I should try again. Gonna try a competing service instead.",
 u'        9/10/2015    Forgot car/house keys in the car. Attempted to contact driver twice a few hours after the incident, he hung up on me both times after I explained why I was calling. Sent an email to uber with no response. Called Uber- voice message saying best way to contact is through email (obviously not). Went to uber headquarters-absolutely no help. The guy in charge of lost and found there said that he was not allowed to contact the driver. What can you do, sir?!?',
 u'        11/3/2014    This rating is for Uber and not the driver. I do not know how the people who run this company sleep at night. I assume it\'s on a stadium sized Vividus encased in one million thread count sheets made from angel hairs that were shorn by a virgin and that they are tucked in by nubile callipygian youths who do so by anointing their bodies with rare oils as a harp plays in the background. That is the type of lifestyle that is surely afforded by a company that has the temerity to charge $69.72 to journey from Prospect Lefferts Gardens to Bushwick. As God is my witness, I\'ll never Uber again! (Or else I may just be forced to start making dresses out of curtains!)Also, word on the street is the drivers don\'t even see an increase in pay during "surge pricing!" For shame!',
 u"        11/11/2015    I wish Uber was around years ago when cabbies didn't want to take me to Downtown Brooklyn. But so far I have had nothing but positive experiences with Uber. I ride the service for convenience but at times they may be a little more pricey than a gypsy or yellow cab. However, I like that I don't have to exchange money which is beneficial for myself and the driver's safety and they take me anywhere I want to go.",
 u'        12/8/2014    Overpriced Gypsy Cabs Paid more then double for a ride that should have costed 15. If its raining and youre in the city, take the subway.These fare hikes need to stop',
 u"        5/26/2016    I, too - like Kathy X (who did a review at the end of 2015) had a similar very positive beginner experience with Uber the first time I used them, but the second and third time were successively somewhat disappointing - and the only reason I've given a 2-star rating instead of a 1-star was because all three drivers I'd gotten were very polite and tried hard to offer me a very satisfactory passenger experience. \xa0So, by way of explanation...On a whim, after not wanting to waitfor what I knew would be forever to get a cab home from my destination. I \xa0decided to download the Uber app and then ordered their economy model vehicle - since I didn't need any bells and whistles - just a ride back home less than a mile away. \xa0And voila, within the 4 minutes I was notified a driver would be at my location, he actually came on time and I had a very relaxing ride home and a nice conversation with Jean, the very affable young driver and more pleased with the experience which sure beat hands-down trying to get either a yellow cab or private car service on the spot, who also assured me my ride would be gratis, since I was a first-time \xa0Uber customer. \xa0So,I \xa0couldn't have been more pleased with this sure beating trying to get either a yellow cab or private car service vehicle - still in rush hour downtown in the West Village. \xa0And then elated with this newly-found convenience as an excellent alternative also to trying to get aforesaid yellow cab or private car anytime after 4pm in my nabe downtown, I decided to only use Uber from then on and not have to deal with aforesaid impossible pressured transportation alternatives anymore.So fast forward to two days later - when I experienced my second Uber ride - again, going to the same destination as Monday, but this time the ride didn't go as smoothly - although the pick-up was on time and again, a very nice and polite driver, somehow he was confused about how to get to my destination with his automatic directions system not working and not quite understanding my very basic instructions to him either - but no biggie, since i was only five minutes late to my appointment (which I found out, after the fact was almost $15 for a ride that would have been half that that I usually paid via yellow cab or that indeed I would have normally paid with Uber, if it wasn't booked at 5pm at the height of rush hour. \xa0Then, on the way back, my frustrating Uber experience reached its apex, since I waited outside (for the driver's convenience in finding me).the location I had called from and instead of coming in the promised 4 - 6 minute time span, it was more like a half hour (!) with my wanting to chance \xa0cancel this ride altogether, but not wanting to be be charged for same and also worried at that point, I indeed wouldn't be able to get an alternative to get back home. \xa0So when the driver finally came, I was very relieved and again, he too, was very polite and friendly and got me to my destination without a problem. \xa0But when I checked the fares sent to me by email later for both trips, I found out that this third fare too, was almost $15 again almost double what a yellow cab would have charged me and at least $4 more than what a private car service charged for that length trip. \xa0And it seemed too as though I was erroneously billed twice for the last trip. \xa0So altogether. I thought i was going to have to shell out almost $45 for what should have been a $16 round trip fare (but after checking my credit card charges, I saw that I was only double-billed online through Uber, but thankfully this charge did not appear on my card.So \xa0after checking on all the info too about Uber's basic policies (this, after I saw my fare fees), I realized that I should have used my basic city-savvy smarts and first \xa0checked out the whole scenario before I set foot in one of their cars - i.e .surcharges for high traffic times like rush hour, and more so if one is in a tonier part of town (huh?) where their service seems to be in higher demand and even fare hikes due to extenuating circumstances like bad weather cohditions or on holidays, etc. \xa0So actually, my own fault for not thoroughly checking for any loopholes in this too good to be true situation beforehand and then paying the price in wasted money, much aggravation and frustration (especially too in trying to get anything resolved through only a virtual operation). \xa0So now, if I decide to venture using them again, I have to make sure it would be during a non-rush hour time and not on a holiday or during bad weather first and just then, hope for the best!",
 u"        5/4/2015    This Thursday I was taking my boyfriend out for a surprise birthday dinner downtown and planned on using UBER thinking it would be easier and nicer to take a car service. \xa0Well, the app was not very user friendly!!! \xa0The established, valid credit card on the account got denied multiple times. I then input another valid credit card, multiple times, which wasalso denied. \xa0Finally, I tried using my valid paypal account which was, you guessed it, \xa0also denied. \xa0 Three VALID payments methods all were denied. \xa0Ridiculous!! \xa0Now it's getting late and I have spent way to much time fooling around with the Uber app. \xa0Hailed down a cab and paid with my credit card on the first swipe. \xa0UBER made us late, spoiled the surprise and in short turned out to be a big hassle. \xa0Yellow cab gets 5 stars.",
 u"        10/27/2014    What is up with all the people who are confused by the price surges?? THEY MAKE YOU CONFIRM THE INCREASE!!! Case in point when I tried to use one on a Saturday night, I got a notice that says because they are busy I will be charged 1.9 x the regular fare. It quoted me $40 to go from the LES to Williamsburg. It then asks you to type in the fare to double confirm. So I guess what I did, because I am a grown up and I can read, I pressed cancel and GOT ON THE TRAIN.If you agree to the fare increase you shouldn't be complaining. It's really not complicated.The drivers are polite and know where they are going unlike the yellow cab dirtbags. Here are some of the questions I've received from NYC yellow cab drivers:Do you want some weed? No? How about some whiskey?When did you lose your virginity? What are you and your boyfriend going to do so late at night? (imagine creepy grin)I can't take anyone who has alcohol with them (I had just come out of Trader Joe's wine store)I'm not going to Brooklyn (even though that is illegal)Not to mention they smell and they're always on the phone.Not only are Uber drivers nothing like that, they come quickly, you get points towards rides if you use your Amex, and they speak English.I've never had a less than stellar experience with Uber. Thank you Uber for being awesome.",
 u"        5/2/2016    Their driver called me 3 times and bullied me and asked me to cancel. Is not that he couldn't find the place, he just didn't want to do the trip for some reason. I tell him I may get charged $5 for cancelling and he is like: No they won't charge you don't worry. I hang up. He calls again: OMG I got pulled over by cops he tells me. At same time I see his car moving fast and nonstop in the app. Third call 2 minutes later: Please cancel I can't come. I'm like: I though you were pulled over by police and he hangs up. Those are exactly same type of people who work most of the yellow cabs, definitely - not much U.S. culture in them.",
 u'        2/26/2015    UberHorrible- 3 bad experiences this week- drivers don\'t speak English- lie about where they are and when they will arrive- 1 driver even told us " I live in Yonkers and don\'t know manhatten!" Never again!!',
 u'        12/17/2015    Really fascinating technical challenges. - The company of incredibly smart and driven people. - Very open culture that encourages independence.',
 u"        4/27/2016    I don't know what to say here other than this is a terrible service! \xa0I was charged $56 for a trip that normally costs me $13. \xa0I reached out to there customer service, it was a nightmare getting anyone. \xa0I was told I would not be receiving any money back and insisted on telling me that I tok the service during a peak hour so the price rises. \xa0I can understand rising costs but 4 1/2 times the amount I normally pay in a regular taxi should be considered theft. \xa0I will never even attempt to take this service again and would recommend the same for anybody.",
 u'        12/30/2014    Over priced. App always giving trouble, no customer service numbers to call. Not good for a big company like them. Need much improvement',
 u"        11/18/2014    Absolutely useless. I had a similar experience to the one cited by another user. I attempted to use a $20 off coupon, which did not load. So I used a cab instead, which was far less than the price quoted by Uber. No, not accepting coupons from the gitgo is not a way to attract customers, that I guarantee you. I've deleted the app and have emailed Uber to remove my account, which has VISA information that I absolutely do not want these people to have.",
 u"        7/14/2015    I used Uber for the first time this past weekend, to go from Forest Hills to the Resorts World Casino in Jamaica. I'm quoted an estimate of $20-$26 and 22 minutes. The driver (who had a 2.7 rating, BTW) claims they didn't tell him where I was going, even though it was entered in the app. He then proceeds to drive around in circles to get to Queens Blvd. (I'm one block off QB) and then heads toward Manhattan, completely in the opposite direction. I try to convince him he's going the wrong way, and 10 minutes later, we're back where we started. Then he goes to turn right on 71st Ave., again in the wrong direction. He blames this on the GPS, saying Uber has a bad GPS system. WHATEVER, I am not a driver and I know Jamaica and Manhattan are in opposite directions.Finally we make our way toward Jamaica. He drives around in circles, makes u-turns and keeps driving us to the same dead end. We're trying to tell him which way to go, but he won't listen. Finally, after 40 minutes, we reach our destination. I ask if I'll be charged for all the extra time/mileage, he says no. I give him a $5 tip despite the mess, because I'm nice that way.I look on the app and see they've charged me nearly $40. I send them a message explaining the situation. They investigate and determine that yes, that was one big sh*tshow of a ride, and refund my money. Immediately. Yay!Then on the way back, the 2nd driver (who completed the trip quickly and correctly) informed me that the 1st driver rated me a bad passenger. WTF? I take this up with Uber and ask how he's allowed to do that, since it was clear he was the one at fault... they told me that themselves! They shouldn't allow him to retaliate against me for his own wrongdoing. They respond and tell me it wouldn't be fair to remove the bad rating he gave me.So you allow him to rip me off, accept a TIP... and then take revenge on me for asking that the fare be adjusted... making other drivers think I'm a bad passenger. Suffice to say, I won't be using this service again.",
 u"        8/1/2015    They are rip off. They give you estimated cost but the driver still but it's mark up 30 to 40%. What made confused was that the driver ask to see my state I'd then held it till I payed. With my card",
 u"        1/14/2015    Uber is a taxi cab service where you download the free App, the app uses your phone's GPS system to track your location, you input your destination and then are able to see the price range before you commit. The map shows where the cab is in reference to where you are located and how long it will take to get to you. You also get your cabbie's name and photo to make sure you are with the right person.If you connect your credit card to your account, it automatically pays through the app (tip included) so you don't need any cash on hand. Your receipt is then emailed to you which includes the total price, the map of the route your cabbie used to get you home, and the length of time it took for you to get home. Overall, this app is a super great tool to use to get from A to B. You don't need any cash on hand, the cabbie even calls you to find out where you are and bring you to the car. Completely awesome app that I will definitely use again :) My one caveat is the car I took was all black so you can't really identify if the car is with Uber or not. Other than that, 4.5 stars, definitely recommend!",
 u"        10/12/2014    I just got ripped off. Quoted $10. Charged $50 after they cancelled on me twice. If your going to charge demand pricing you shouldn't show up an hour late. The Uber team reviewed my receipt. Apparently I was quoted for an Uberx, but for some reason when I requested the uber from the quote I was sent an Uber black car. Logical. I did get a partial refund as the driver did not take an optimal route, but disappointed in the discontinuity of the app and the lack of service for such a high cost for a ten minute ride.",
 u'        10/24/2014    I will never make the mistake again of taking any type of Uber ride to JFK next time I visit NYC. For the price I was charged, $110.33, I could have taken a cab or another car service for $30-$50 less. I was aware of the surcharge so I HAVE ONLY MYSELF TO BLAME. What make this charge so insulting is that for that price, I was in an economy car as per UberX allows. I can see paying that price for a town car but a Prius? Ridiculous and a rip off. The driver BTW was very nice, on time and polite.Thank you for listening. I reported this incident to The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission as well as Uber itself. What this has taught me is that Uber is not the best deal going nor is it always the easiest. Buyer beware!',
 u"        11/20/2014    What is up with Uber? No estimate for fair any more? Do they just expect u to get in can and pay any amount? Uber used to provide a price estimate. Cab shows up and even driver can't answer how much ride will be. Sorry Uber I won't get in that cab.",
 u"        4/27/2016            Updated reviewI am not an Uber fan but had a 50% off promotion coupon added to my account for UberX and UberPool so when the subway wasn't working we decided to get an UberPool. Big mistake. We live on the upper west side and the second passenger lives on the upper west side and both pick ups were on the west side yet we end up going uptown on the east side. Apparently there was surge pricing which I was not aware of so the ride which was shared and longer than a normal can cost significantly more than a yellow cab. Finally I did not get my 50% off. Will never use them again and will definitely not recommend them to anyone. Use yellow cabs - kind, courteous and reliable.",
 u"        8/10/2015    I have used Uber twice, and both experiences were fine ... except for a minor glitch the first time, when the driver told me he was to pick up someone else, after I told him my last name (instead of my first name). We quickly resolved it when I told him my first name and also showed him that I had his photo in my iPhone. Unfortunately, I have to reduce my rating to two stars because their web service STINKS if you ever have a problem with the app, and I did. I have been unable to order a new ride because the app is stuck on my most recent ride ... and there's no easy way to contact Uber for help with that. So it looks like I will never be able to ask for another ride, at least not on this iPhone. Good bye, Uber.",
 u'        8/18/2015    I left my iphone in one of tour cars (license plate T659826C, FHV license number 5587026, drivers TLC license number 5186418 ) and 5 minutes after I called my phone and it is off. I highly suspect the driver got my phone and turned it off as it was fully charged and when I called it (5 min after leaving the car) it was off.I cannot believe this happened with an uber service. Ive been trying to call the driver since I left the car, therefore i emailed you to get a more helpful alternative, and you tell me to keep on calling. Please let me know what else can be done about this',
 u"        10/18/2014    This company seriously sucksI got charged twice for a rideThe first ripoff was being charged $30 cash for a ride estimated it to be $16 - There was no traffic no rush-hour no rain - And fact about three other drivers fought over the fair and a second one charge me For trip that never occurred - The driver \xa0demanded actually40 bucks plus tip. Only after my protested we settle on 30. \xa0There was no receipt no nothing. \xa0Uber is a fucking joke.I could've just as easily taken a taxi or car service I' was ripped off.The other matters of the driver didn't know how to get to the destination even though it was a straight line And he was using Iphone GPSAre lots of other alternatives- Save your time and money.",
 u'        5/15/2016    I took a pool ride from the Bronx to Hilton airport Newark. I thought it is reasonable to share with airport goers. Instead Uber took a ride to Manhattan first with 2 other passengers that were picked after me. The trip was twice as long and almost the same price as a direct commute. I made a mistake!! I would like uber to give me a friendly way to choose my options. Once you press "pool"" and get a price how you can change it? It seems that Uber is testing the limits of their customers',
 u"        12/11/2014    I am a native New Yorker for 50 years and know the city and its inner workings very well. I also have not experienced a traffic nightmare as the one we just had on my first uber ride. We went from Chinatown to Jackson Heights which is normally a $20 ride. What's shocking to me is I was charged over $100 for the same ride. No where on the app is there a estimate for cost. For $100 I could go to JFK airport twice from Manhattan. Even in a yellow cab you get an idea of how much the fare is as it ticks up on the meter. I find the fact that your fares are hidden from your app and your uber cars predatory. I look forward to a satisfactory response from you Uber otherwise there will be no further relationship and my family and friends will also be warned of the lack of transparency of the pricing.Let's see what kind of response I get.Update:After less than a day, Uber did repsonse and they refunded me $50 which in my mind is satisfactory. Because of this customer service, I will consider using them again. There is a estimate on the app which I didn't know. ( A bit of a learning curve on their app needed ) They now have Uberpool which allows you to share a ride with a stranger and also reduce the cost of the ride.",
 u"        8/3/2015    Uber has been a perfect solution for my personal beef with taxis here in Jersey City. I hate the dishonesty of most cab companies and especially the ones in Jersey City. With Uber you know who your dealing with and so do they. The drivers are usually super kind and courteous. I have had one bad driver, and I've had one smelly driver; but that's out of about 100 trips! Uber Rocks!",
 u"        9/26/2015    Oh uber, where do I begin. Ever since I found you I don't have to speak to nasty dispatchers on the phone. \xa0I no longer have to be asked how many people and be driven around with strangers. No more dirty cars or cigarette smoking drivers. \xa0What I get now is courteous drivers in clean cars. Safe, Respectful and comfortable transportation. I love everything about Uber.",
 u'        7/20/2015    I am a huge fan of Uber...except in New York City. I consistently have bad luck with incorrect locations, cancelled pick ups and just unreliable service. I hate to use the grouchy yellow cabs but they are most efficient when in the City during the day. Evening Uber pick ups are slightly more reliable from my experience.',
 u'        2/25/2016    the first time I used uber the driver arrives and takes off in less than 30 seconds before I could even get to the door. which I get a cancellation fee for. when trying to get a refund, which no joke took 2 months, as they cared about as much as an insurance company, I get a $5 credit...seriously?',
 u"        6/25/2015    Worthless. \xa0I request a ride and the app tells me the guy will pick me up in 5 minutes. \xa010 minutes later he calls me and tells me traffic is bad, and it will be another 15 minutes. \xa0I cancel the ride.Here's the best part: They actually charge me $10! I complain and they offer me a $10 ride credit. \xa0I complain again and they say they will credit me the $10 on my credit card. \xa0A week later, still hasn't happened yet.",
 u"        11/21/2014    Sometime Uber is great and sometimes horrible. \xa0Just not consistent enough not give more than 2 stars. \xa0Drivers are nice but often have no idea where they're going and get lost either picking me up, taking me or both.Never had a probelm with a taxi in Secaucus, NJ.",
 u"        2/9/2016    Uber used to be fantastic. Always very fast. Pricing is slightly more expensive than car service, but that depends on the time of day. I loved using it in NYC for 6 months. Recently however, I've switched back to car service. Uber has become increasingly unreliable. I have often requested uber rides and had them cancelled 4 times in a row, and missed appointments due to this lack of consistency and reliability. It used to be excellent, but is now no longer worth the headache of wondering if your driver will actually pick you up, and whether or not you'll get \xa0where you need to on time. For value and reliability, I'm back to using car service.",
 u'        6/15/2015    Driver relied too much on GPS to the point he was making unsafe lane changes. I had to provide "extra eyes" to let him know he could merge. And again using the GPS so much he was traveling 10-15 mph slower than the rest of traffic. The car appeared nice and clean but smelled quite strongly of cigarettes. Thus was NOT the uber experience I was hoping or have come to appreciate. They may be expanding too aggressively that they are willing to hire anyone remotely qualified, and their product is obviously suffering. In a city like this with so many options, it is easy enough to spend your money elsewhere. Responses to concerns for safety are returned by a bot named "Yvette" letting you know that they know and are working on it. \xa0Right . . .',
 u"        1/9/2015    Recently Uber is just disappointing... one ride from 25th St & 5th Ave to Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown around 8:30pm cost me $39.16!!!! I took regular taxi from Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown back to 30th St and 6th Ave (even further) only $14!!!Crazy... I felt completely been ripped off!Another ride was from 12th St & University to JFK airport at 5:30pm on Sunday night...was charged $88....I will much rather to wave for taxi in the city or call car service to JFK now.",
 u'        10/28/2016    I like the idea of Uber but have to say it\'s far easier to use at an airport than from home. UberX is typically more expensive than green cabs and UberPool is hit and miss. But my real issue is with expectations. On several occasions, the app has said my driver is "10" minutes away and 20 minutes later, they\'re still 10 minutes away. Then if you cancel, they charge a cancellation rate as if this comedy is your fault. At one point, I was paranoid that it was me but a driver friend said my rating was five stars. The reality is that these aren\'t all professional drivers. Some are people making a bit of cash on the side; some are limo drivers who supplement their day jobs (one guy drove me uptown at Formula One speeds because he was technically being paid to wait for a limo client ... the transport equivalent of a clandestine affair). And the resentment of Uber\'s fees runs deep. For a company that offers little more than a platform to connect driver and customer, they don\'t do a lot to get their 30% cut. (Try reaching a human if you have a problem; I sometimes think CEO Travis K is like that guy on the Wizard of Oz, operating some machine behind a curtain so you think there\'s a bigger presence at HQ when it\'s only him) ... but I digress. Sharing economy or not, you get what you pay for.',
 u"        4/9/2015            Updated reviewI have been using Uber more since last year and I haven't had any issues since my first two surge pricing issues.Most of the drivers I get are very nice and polite and a few even refuse tips, which really impresses me.",
 u'        10/26/2016    I love the concept of Uber and was pretty excited when they first emerged. Even though I have definitely been price gouged more times than I care to admit, I still used them for the sake of convenience. Recently, however, they crossed a line. I agreed to an $8 fare while in NYC and when the driver pulled up to the curb, a bit of foam from my coffee spilled out on the vinyl seat. I told him I had some tissues in my purse and wanted to quickly wipe it. He said he had to go, to not worry about it. I reiterated that it would just take a minute but he said he had to go, to please not worry about it. So I got out - and then received a $40 "cleaning fee" from Uber. When I wrote support and explained what happened, they said the fee would not be waived, regardless and that the case was resolved. Surprisingly callous "customer service". I called my credit card company to dispute it. First time I\'ve ever had to dispute a fee where I knew exactly how I was being taken from. Glaringly obvious effort to charge a fee, overall, and a very disappointing follow up.',
 u"        1/27/2016    Awesome app, friendly drivers, clean cars, prompt pickups, I don't understand where all the negative reviews come from. \xa0They actually show up unlike neighborhood car services, when Uber is scheduled, they will come, even in middle of night! \xa0A++++ Awesome all the way!!",
 u'        7/11/2015    I finish my trip and received a receipt. \xa0And later they had send me an corrected receipt for 300 percent charge. \xa0A 3 miles drive with traffic jams \xa0half hours ride for 67.00 dollars.',
 u"        2/2/2015    Love the concept and when I can get one, love the experience - the drivers are nice, car clean, and don't' have to fiddle with my wallet to pay for the ride. \xa0The issue is that I can't always get one due to price surges or the car is too far away and I rather just catch a taxi which is nearby.",
 u"        2/19/2015    The service is convenient, thats why so many people are using it. But the drivers suck and so does the cost. I was coming from Jersey, to Brooklyn. The Uber driver asked if I wanted to pay cash and turned off the app. (When they do this in Italy they want your tourist money) He then proceeded to charge me an unauthorized $155 which is pocket change for him since the meter was off. I threw him $60 and told him to leave, since he's not even supposed to do that. Ridiculous pricing, for a ridiculous service I will never use again.",
 u"        1/23/2016    Uber is good if you need a cheap ride and you don't know any other places in the area. I used uber about 6 times and 3 times out of the 6 I wasn't happy. one time the driver was talking about the drunks who he picks up at night throwing up in the car and all i am thinking about is how good he cleaned the puke up because there was a smell in the car. another time i went on a 10 minute ride and driver almost got into 3 accidents and the 3rd time was driver was racing me to my house and driving like a nut and i thought i was gonna get sick. amateur drivers who you are trusting with your life. i will still use them for convenience and price but i would never take uber with my family because you never know what driver you will get.",
 u"        12/4/2014    My driver didn't know where he was going. He missed my exit 5 times and added over 30 minutes to my travel time. He thinks he did my a favor by reimbursing me 40 dollars. AWFUL. If i could give it 0 stars I would.Uber rips you off. you're better off taking public transportation.I tried to contact them via email because it's the only way you actually can!Thieves.",
 u'        6/8/2015    Signed up for Uber, linked to my credit card and verified via my cell. Hadn\'t used it yet; 3 days after I signed up, I get an e-mail from them asking me to verify by e-mail address by clicking. Clicked and got a sign-in page (I checked that it really was Uber, not some scam). \xa0Signed in and got a message saying my Uber account had been frozen, and I should e-mail Uber support. I did, asking why my account was frozen. Got a reply saying I need to e-mail them a copy of my credit card and driver\'s license to verify my identity. I e-mailed back saying how unsafe that was, and asking why was my account frozen? Reply was "You can cover up everything but the last 4 digits of your credit card and your name and photo on the ID. It\'s perfectly safe." Well, NOT. Plus any scammer with Photoshop can do that. And how will my photo tell them anything; they\'ve never seen me? And if my account is compromised, scammer already knows the last 4 digits of my credit card. So that\'s not safe for me or them. I e-mailed them back and asked why my account was frozen. Also asked if I was dealing with a live person or an automated customer service system. I got one more e-mail back asking if I intended to send the required documentation. I asked again why my account was frozen, and said I appeared to be dealing with a machine. Never heard from them again. Cancelled that credit card. Uber seems like a great idea, if they can ever get their customer service working. I don\'t intend to wait and find out. Not with such insecure systems.',
 u'        1/24/2015    I have been proud to use Uber for over a year now in NY, Paris and London and have never had an issue. yes some drivers cancel unexpectedly but I would rather have that than a rude unprofessional nyc taxi driver who tries to rip me off - despite me knowing the routes better than he does in my city!',
 u"        8/3/2015    1 check-in        No real complains, super convenient , better than any cab and the fact that it's paid through the app, it's great. \xa0No need to swipe a card or pay cash, you get yo your destination and just say good bye to driver",
 u'        9/18/2016    I use uber frequently and find them to be more efficient than there competitors. However, last night was my friends bachelorette party and we had a horrible and appalling experience. Our driver Muhammed Bah picked us up at 6:30 was unbelievably rude and offensive. I went to sit in the front seat and he said to me, "Don\'t you know the rule the fat person has to sit in the front seat." When I stared at him confused, he then said, " Dont you understand your friend is fat . She is fat and she should sit in the front seat." When I said to him,"My friend is not fat and I think it\'s best that you focus on driving." He said "you are not understanding me, I am saying that she is fat and you are not and she should sit in the front." The four of us in the car contacted uber and have not received a response. He was repeatedly calling my friend fat in the middle of her bachelorette party and he literally put a damper on the entire night. For someone to get all done up and repeatedly be called fat (because they are not a stick) in the middle of their party was literally depressing...',
 u"        1/9/2016    If I can give uber zero stars I would. Tried uber for the first time today and it has been the worst experience of my life. Who the hell takes 34 street all the way across from 12 ave to 2nd at 4 o'clock during rush hour? It is so obvious these drivers are either stupid or purposely try to run the meter as much as they can to screw people out of their money. Deleting the app asap. Yellow cab drivers aren't perfect but at least they know where the hell they are going and are reasonably priced. Furthermore, yellow cab drivers have their own apps like arrow and way 2 ride. Just as good if not better than uber with no surge pricing ever!! The hell with uber",
 u'        7/30/2016    Used to love this service, but it\'s rapidly gone downhill. \xa0In the last 5 or 6 times I\'ve used it, I\'ve had a few drivers circle around and around my pickup location or just stay in one place for like 10 mins (and this all happened before I had an important interview or appointment to get to, or a flight to catch!). \xa0One of the drivers explained that it\'s best to manually type in the address of your pickup location because GPS isn\'t always reliable (funny, b/c I\'d always used GPS to set my pickup location, and there was never a problem until recently). \xa0Oh, and the most memorably terrible experience was when a driver I\'d been waiting almost 10 mins for refused to pick up the phone when I called him, and then he whizzed right past me without even glancing in my direction! \xa0I had to cancel the ride, of course, and luckily I was credited back the cancellation fee. \xa0But then I had to wait for another Uber driver to pick me up, and this one didn\'t speak any English! \xa0I told him that I had a flight to catch, so it\'d be great if he could hurry, but he just said "Eh?" like he didn\'t understand. \xa0I repeated myself several times, but he just ignored me and continued driving at a leisurely pace. \xa0I would\'ve missed my flight had it not been delayed! \xa0I just started using Lyft, and so far it\'s been good--hopefully it stays that way and that this means I won\'t have to use Uber again!',
 u"        10/16/2014    Hit or miss service. Some of the drivers have been exceptional. Others make me debate if a yellow cab is a better option. Some of the drivers have no idea how to use their GPS - or worse - don't know where they are going. I feel with this service - that is totally unacceptable.Some of the drivers are on top of their game - others - you'd swear they got their license off a packet of corn flakes.Avoid this service on the peak hours. It can be a very costly ride.",
 u"        6/16/2015    I used Uber pool to get from SOHO to Newark airport. I was quoted 51.00 which was much less than a taxi. The driver got lost coming to me so I cancelled. I rebooked and in 1 minute the wonderful driver showed up for 52.00. Luckily I booked before the big downpour as I had heard there was a up charge when it rained. I really felt like I was in a town car and the driver was so nice and a great driver. There was lots of traffic through the tunnel but the trip was easy. I wasn't happy that I received a bill for 10.00 for the cancelled original driver since it was after 5 minutes of booking. I even tried calling the driver and I couldn't understand him and he didn't know how to get to my hotel. We never got another passenger so I was alone. It worked out great in the end. I hope Uber will refund my $10 as it wasn't my fault to cancel",
 u"        12/26/2014    Used Uber while I'm at work in San Francisco and Los Angeles. \xa0Decided to use it while visiting NYC this past weekend with family. The fare is much less than the taxi cabs we used prior to making the decision to use uber as it was more convenience and the cleanliness to each vehicles we rode were fantastic. \xa0I was very happy with the uber drivers that picked me and my family up while in NYC - Alsh O, Ahmed, Naeem and Alejandro. \xa0Thank you..",
 u'        2/21/2015    Thought Uber was a good thing. Thought wrong. Taxi from 34th St Penn Station to my house in Brooklyn a few days ago cost me NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS!!! I could\'ve jumped on a Greyhound to AC and back for that price. Also, I notice that Uber drivers cancel on you once they get the alert that they\'re driving to BK from Manhattan. I stood outside in the freezing cold for almost 20 minutes waiting on an Uber pick-up due to cancellations. Finally, a driver named Tarik arrived to take me on a very "long way home", costly, extremely chatty ride to Brooklyn. Scru Uber.',
 u"        12/18/2015    UBER IS DANGEROUS - An Uber driver locked me in the car and then stood in front of the door to block my exit. I reported it, and Uber did nothing about it. Believe everything you read about how unsafe it is due to lack of regulation and internal controls. It's not worth saving a few bucks and risking personal safety. This was a horrifying experience that I plan to share with everyone I know.",
 u"        7/28/2015    5 rides over the weekend! Great service! Prompt service! Very clean cars. Wonderful drivers. Will use anytime I'm in the city.",
 u'        7/21/2015    I took uber twice today. On a round trip one way was around $18 while the way back was $29. I wrote a review and uber responded right away and changed my total for the trip home to be about the $18 I spent on the way there. It is great to know that they are looking out for the consumer when a driver takes advantage of the passenger and goes a longer route.',
 u'        6/10/2015    I used to be a huge fan of uber and used it all the time in NYC, but be careful!! they are no longer reliable, they charge you card 10$ for cancelation but you are NOT compensated at all when a driver cancels the trip after you waited for them forever!! the drivers are barely speaking english ! one time i was going to jfk in the snow, i had \xa02 suitcases - the driver just seat in the car and did not help me to put the bags in the trunk - he said he has new shoes and does not want them to get dirty!!!!! at the airport i said will you help me naw? there is no snow or rain here - and he said no because he does not feel like it!!! ps i am 5 foot tall!!!',
 u"        4/22/2015    I used Uber for a number of months, and despite the fact that I had some really negative experiences (including a driver who ran multiple red lights and was clearly intoxicated), I suck with them because it was convenient.But then Uber became horrendous. I had my wallet stolen and had to re-set my credit card. \xa0Which I did. \xa0But stupid Uber still tried to charge my old credit card number, so clearly the charge bounced, and then they BLOCKED ME FROM USING THE APP. \xa0Like, blacklisted my email address, can't ever log in, nothing. \xa0There is no number to call. \xa0There is no way to talk to someone. \xa0Just frozen. After NUMEROUS emails over the course of the week I had my account opened again. \xa0With the same, active, normal credit card. \xa0Then the following week, account frozen again. \xa0I check my bank statements -- all charges went through fine. Don't get me wrong, I am FINE taking regular cabs. \xa0But in NYC now half the cabs are only doing Uber pickups and you are seriously disadvantaged without the app. \xa0It's completely ridiculous. \xa0I've never experienced this with any other app. \xa0They are HORRENDOUS. \xa0Please leave -- no, GTFO of -- our great city.",
 u"        7/18/2015    I've only had great experiences with uber. What I like the most is that your ride can't be stolen from you as it happens so often with yellow cabs. I was waiting patiently for the previous customers to exit the cab, when a family came and coerced the driver to take them instead. Uber just makes things 100% easier.",
 u"        4/23/2015    Absolutely Horrible! \xa0I didn't even get to use the service before I had a load of problems. \xa0Pickup request would not go through. \xa0They wanted to charge my card for something I didn't use. \xa0And to top it off you can't even speak to a live person to correct any issues. \xa0You have to send an email!!!! \xa0told them to delete the account!",
 u'        5/13/2015    I signed up with a promo code that allows for $30 off for the first two rides for new members. Signing up was no issue, but uber.com does not allow you to verify whether the code is valid unless you sign up. I created my login/password and entered in my cell and credit card #s. Only after signing up do you see the terms of the promo code which in my case mandates that I use a Capital One credit card which I do not own. In other words, the promo code was useless to me, and the site does not allow you to apply any new codes in place of the existing one. I checked the Uber.com help page which did not help, so I wrote to uber support. I received a reply from one of their reps simply stating "tough luck", we can\'t swap out your current useless code with another code but check our help page (which I already stated I did) and you can invite others to join so you can both get discounts on future rides (which I already knew). The point is I joined to take advantage of the initial new member promo code. I wrote back asking if they can just mark the code as used so I can just apply a new one instead then or if not, can they delete my account so I can create a new one, but the site itself does not have an option to delete your own account. I also noticed the site does not allow you to remove your credit card nor to edit it. Looks like they\'ve locked your credit card into their system along with your cell phone # which I can\'t change either. So far not having a good experience with Uber. What kind of company and support can\'t make simple edits and won\'t allow you to edit your own credit card # or phone #? With a low end web design and support who are unable to make simple edits, I hope I didn\'t just expose my credit card # and cell phone and other information to a site that leaves itself vulnerable to attacks. \xa0:(',
 u'        3/3/2015    Absolutely worst company I have ever had to deal with! They charged me $60 for an 8 minute cab ride using UberPool, not even Uber. I ended up waiting 30 minutes for my driver because he was searching for other passengers to pick up. The surcharge was absolutely outrageous. I contacted customer support, which was ZERO help. I couldnt even get someone to speak on the phone with me. They refused to give me any sort of refund or even a credit towards another uber ride. I will never use this company again. I use car services almost daily for my business and after this horrible experience will stop using this service. Horrible horrible and very disappointing company.',
 u'        6/24/2015    Love this service better than taking the metro. There here in no time at all and to get across town 14.00. So far everyone has been very nice.',
 u"        3/1/2015    Horrible. I used my 30 off promo code and when I got to my destination it wasn't even included they charged me the full amount. Yet the promo code said it was successfully applied. If I were any of you I would honestly use a regular cab service or even lyft. I will never use uber again. Stay away.",
 u'        10/13/2014    Used Uber for the first time last night driver called right away to confirm. \xa0The car was clean, driver was clean and friendly. \xa0He was a great driver and quickly got us to our destination. I would suggest looking for a promo code to try it. Will def use again.',
 u"        2/12/2015    In general, I enjoy the service. But one driver can really screw it up for everyone else.I have been using Uber for years. There have been some great rides and some just okay rides. But none were awful. First, my driver this morning came to the wrong address. That then forced me towalk with a heavy box (which is why I called the car in the first place). I mentioned that he came to the wrong address and he started yelling at me and then kept telling me that I needed to cancel the ride. I assume he didn't want to cancel because he didn't want a bad rating since I was annoyed he came to the wrong address. I was like, well if you don't want to take me, that's fine. I can get another car but you should cancel because I don't want to get charged. And he went off on the street, started screaming at me and told me he would remove me from his car (I was sitting inside because technically the ride had officially started and I didn't expect him to go off like this). I finally just hailed a cab, cancelled the uber, and then wrote in to protest the $10 cancellation fee since I was basically forced to cancel by the driver because he didn't want to cancel the ride.Drivers like this should NOT be on the road. I was annoyed but he could have easily regained a 5 star rating by helping me with my box, being nice, etc. Instead, his anger made me feel threatened as he was irrationally screaming at me in the middle of the street.",
 u'        5/17/2015    Uber RIP OFF. Please do not charge me $60 for a 2 mile ride. I have had cheaper Uber rides going to the airport. I guess the drivers can just charge whatever they want? Will not use again.',
 u"        6/3/2015    Not only my ride to LaGuardia on May 14th 2015 turned out to be a ride from hell with a driver who spoke little to no English, had only been driving in NYC for 3 months and didn't know how to go to the airport, which forced me to navigate; getting through to Uber's customer service is like hitting the Lotto jackpot, almost impossible. Almost a month later they decide to refund 1/2 the fare, of what should have been a full refund. This company keeps digging their graves deeper and deeper with the horror stories of more and more customers. Now that they're expanding to restaurants and dog walking, good luck to those who trust them with ur next meal or your precious pet #neveragain",
 u"        10/18/2015    I was SHOCKED at the pricing for Uber in New York! They're surge pricing is almost all day everyday! I would HIGHLY recommend using a taxi while there. We found the taxi to be just as easily accessible and found them to be MUCH cheaper! I was leaving to the La Guardia airport from Times Square on a Sunday at 6pm, I checked Uber and they wanted $77 to get me there!!!!! I chose the taxi and paid $43! The taxi drivers were just as nice, there cars were in fine shape. I think the surge pricing is ridiculous! I hope people start to boycott it! Use a cab, you'll save A LOT of money!!!!!",
 u"        3/30/2015    Wrong person got in my UBER. They were four blocks from my pickup address, not even on my correct street.. Charged me $60 to my credit card. Not even a problem.... BUT to contact UBER they only have email. So a million dollar company can't afford a customer call center! WOW",
 u'        4/18/2015    I heard many good things about uber, but never had a need to use until today when my guest needed to go to JFK. I downloaded app, signed up, entered credit card information and when I tried to request a car, got a message that there is a problem with a credit card reading. I entered another card information. Same thing. Then my husband downloaded the app, but got same error message when requesting a car. And there is no phone number to call, or text, no email address to ask for help. There is definitely no issues with credit cards as I called my credit card company and they ensured that there was no attempt to charge it. We gave up and got a local car service for the same price which was estimated on uber.',
 u"        11/8/2015    When I first heard about uber \xa0and decided to try it was very impressed and fascinated because their cars arrived very fast and before you request for a driver the app showed you the name and face of the driver and plate of car and approximate time of arrival and when he arrived you either got a text or call to notify you.the charges were a little less than the other cabs, so it seemed very efficient and transparent.l got excited and started using it more till one night I requested for ride as always and my driver showed was on his way and the next thing my ride was cancelled and my account charged $10, I was very furious because I didn't cancel the ride and I didn't get a text or call to notify me that he had arrived outside my workplace because I didn't want to wait in the street at 4am n get mugged.l see a charge on my bank account n I try to make a complaint, it took me a day to get a response back from some site they have set up to send emails, there was no phone number I could call and the reply was very brief and saying they auto charge when a driver arrives and wait more than 2 mins ......yes but why wasn't I notified of his arrival as before, do they do this on purpose to steal people's money because they have access to their accounts.l ended up getting another uber and being charged another $6 for my ride and why the hack does uber charge more for a cancelled trip than the amount of the trip? I lost all respect and support for this uber and what worries me the most is giving them our bank account details so that they can withdraw money without us being given the opportunity to say yes or no \xa0in-between the process, even in cases like this where the service was not provided at all. I am sorry but am going back to the traditional way put the meter on and I pay you cash right there , no freaking weird charges on my card for services not granted !!!!! Very disappointed !",
 u"        5/10/2015    Two things. First, a friend used Uber to go from Washington Heights to the UES, and it was more than a car service--about $15 more.Second, I went to sign up anyway, for those late night or rainy night occasions when no cabs are around, and it isn't working. It doesn't accept my email (just created) and no one from Customer service will respond. Very frustrating, as they already have my credit card info.",
 u"        5/28/2015    UBER is a nightmare. \xa0I received an email verifying a charge for a trip I never made. \xa0The ride took place in Chicago and I live in NYC. \xa0Try to reach UBER, no phone support, their website is not helpful either. \xa0I finally got an email address to write to: support@uber.com. \xa0 I received a response that indicated they never read my request. \xa0Because they were telling me how to change my password. \xa0I'm asking them to delete my account and all my information because I can't do it on-line. \xa0I'll keep you all posted on my progress. \xa0But buyer beware.",
 u'        11/21/2015    I just got a free ride from Morristown NJ to home. \xa0I used the promo code uberMorristown when I signed up for an account.',
 u"        2/13/2015    Driver realized I was tourist and took me on a 2 hour run around which should've taken 25 min. I was then charged by uber for this triple the fee. Still waiting on them to resolve it. Crazy",
 u'        12/23/2014    I wish there was an option to not even give Uber and their drivers a star at all.Drivers are sleezy and will charge you whatever they feel like for your trip. I took a driver, a black cadillac, and the trip took 10 minutes. The driver, however, thought it would be a great idea to continue my trip for another 2 hours to his final destination of Elmhurst, Queens. What is normally a 15.00 max cab ride, cost me 92.98.PLEASE if you are going to support this disgusting company, make sure you check that the driver has ended your trip.. you could end up with a hefty charge for a quick trip. Uber- for all the heat you are taking in the media and across the country, you would think you would better prepare your drivers and employees to be on their best behavior. When I say you are a sleezy, pathetic excuse for a public service, that does not even do it justice.To all Uber users, think twice before booking a ride. You could be out 100.00.',
 u"        12/3/2015    Normally I'm a big fan of Uber In most cases they cost about half of what a cab charges. So far all the cars have been very clean and don't smell like bad body odor and cheap car air freshness and so far all my drivers have been very nice I just tried UBER in Ny for the first time. The estimated fee for my destination was between $14 and $18 My driver picked us up within 3 mins he was very friendly and kept apologizing because of the traffic and having to reroute because roads were blocked due to the Christmas tree lighting at Rockefeller center. Due to the surcharge plus the fact they were charging by the mile and time in the car \xa0a 10 min drive turned out to be 29 mins. What should had been a trip under $20 turned out to be over $40 and we never reached my destination. We finally just told him to drop us off we could walk the last 3 blocks. We took a cab back to our origin from where we were dropped off and it was only $12 I asked the \xa0Uber driver about the charges he explained to me that Uber always jacks the prices up during rush hours or when it's a big event to try and attract more drivers to get on the road. The driver was extremely courtesy and apologetic which it's not his fault when Uber does the up charges and surcharges. Even though my fee was more then estimated I still tipped him $10. If you ever use Uber in a big city like NY BE SURE ITS NOT DURING RUSH HOUR OR BIG EVENTS I suggest you just take a cab or use uber ride share so your not having to pay a large few",
 u"        6/29/2015    I am a regular Uber user. \xa0I've used them in every borough except the Bronx. \xa0 I always chose Uber pool and am quoted a price up front. \xa0Out of the multiple times I've had the pleasure of using Uber pool I've only had to share my car with someone twice. \xa0There has been no crazy surcharge prices and as I already stated the price is quoted up front. \xa0Drivers have been very polite and in comparison to yellow cab drivers, I'm not sure why people think that they are any better than Uber drivers. \xa0I've never gotten the disgruntled look that I receive from yellow cab drivers when I tell them I need to go from Manhattan to Brooklyn and I'm using a credit card. \xa0A lot of times Uber has actually been cheaper than taking a yellow cab or car service.",
 u'        4/6/2015    Scumbags charged me $10 for "not showing up" yet I never moved from my location not did the driver call me, he was circling my block on te map but never made any effort.Maybe just a bad driver but the charge was a disgust! Back to yellow cabs for me!!',
 u'        4/12/2015    I have been a faithful uber customer for a long time, yet after the problem I had yesterday, I will never use it again.For the first time ever, I opted to go with uberpool instead of regular uber. Regular uber\'s estimate charge was $ 30-$38 for the trip. After the pool matched me with another rider, uber showed that I will be saving %50 (not up to %50, clearly stated as "%50 saving").The car came, with the other rider picked up from elsewhere, picked me up, dropped me to the place I was going, and took of with that passenger who was in the car when I was picked up.To my surprise, I was charged the whole amount of $38, instead of the $19 I was supposed to pay.Well, this can happen. I would understand that. However which caused me to decide never to use uber again is the response of uber customer service.I wrote them the situation, and told them "hi, i came with pool, but changed the full amount instead of%50 as shown. Would you please correct the mistake".The reply I got was "When matched with another rider, you can expect your uberPOOL ride to be 20-50% cheaper than if you\'d taken the same uberX ride alone. If you\'re not connected with another rider, your solo trip will cost the same as a normal uberX trip.".Ok, probably my bad that I was not clear enough in my first email, so I sent a second one explaining the situation in more detail.Here is my second email: "I was already matched, \xa0that is the issue. \xa0And it said it will cost%50 less, hence i wrote the previous email.So what happened is, I came with a stranger by uber pool, (the person was coming from XYZ going to ABC), and after I got the uberpool, it showed something like "you are matched, you will save %50". However from (address in here)Queens to (address ine here) in Manhattan (which the regular cost is $30-$40) I have been charged not the pool amount, but the whole amount.Which is why, I should have paid $38/2=$19 minus the $10 credit I already had $9, instead of the $38 minus $10 credit $28. Please fix the issue and credit me in the overcharged amount, which should be $19. Thanks"You cannot imagine what the reply I got was. "I\'ve taken another look and it doesn\'t seem like an uberPOOL match was made for this trip. Because of this, I\'m unable to adjust this fare. It\'s important that our partners are compensated appropriately for their time and expenses." \xa0Well ok, your system might have had a trouble, and in my case it clearly did. Could not you instead ask your driver about the situation? I am sure that the driver would have told the truth. He was actually a great guy, and I would bet on him telling the truth. Customer relations 101, before telling the customers that they are lying, make some research. what you mean by "I\'ve taken another look and it doesn\'t seem like an uberPOOL match was made for this trip", I am giving you the address guy was picked up, and will be dropped off, check your system for god\'s sake. I just sent them a final message: "Dear kris, feel free to check that with the driver, we were matched with an (Nationality here, we had a nice conversation en route) gentleman who was picked up from XYZ. Shall that issue go unresolved, \xa0i will regretfully close my uber account i have been using since i moved to US, as that will damage my trust in uber irreparably. \xa0$19 is an insignificant amount for me, \xa0but unkept promises are something i won\'t agree. \xa0Thanks"Anyway, I will keep it up to date if a progress happens, however even if they credit me the full amount, that will not change my idea regarding their customer service.',
 u"        5/24/2016    This is a specific review of UberPool (I normally ride UberX and have good experiences). \xa0Please just stay away from UberPool for your own good. \xa0According to Uber, it will save you money. \xa0I think not, and will never use it again (I was an idiot for trying). \xa0A trip from Manhattan to EWR, and it cost me almost $118 (I can get UberX or a Black Car for a lot less). \xa0On top of that, I was in a car that would seat two other people comfortably, with three other folks. \xa0The guy in the front seat was going to EWR as well......and I'm sure he paid close to what I paid as well. \xa0I guess that UberPool is good for Uber. \xa0I tried to understand exactly why I was charged this much, and contacted Uber customer service via several emails. \xa0My conclusion is that I paid for the entire trip since I was the first customer, and all of the other pickups were just profit. \xa0Customer service keeps mumbling about adjusting algorithms......but can't explain what happened. \xa0By the way, there is never any surge pricing symbol on UberPool....explain that. \xa0The driver was great.......not his fault at all!",
 u"        5/19/2016    My daughter needed to get to school quickly yesterday morning so I told her she could take an uber. \xa0She had taken it a few times before and she was able to get to school in 20-25 minutes rather than 45-60 on the bus/subway. \xa0She was cutting it close yesterday so when she ordered the car and it said it would be there in 6 minutes, she accepted it since that would still give her enough time to get there by 8:15. \xa0However, she checked again after 4 minutes and now it said the car would be there in 8 minutes, rather than the 2 additional minutes she was expecting to wait. \xa0She knew she wouldn't make it if she had to wait 8 more minutes so she cancelled it and tried a different car service but had no luck with those either. \xa0So, she went back onto uber and now it said a car would be there in 3 minutes, so she accepted it even though she knew she would be too late (no chance on bus or subway at this point). \xa03 minutes turned into 6 and she ended up getting to school a full 15 minutes late. \xa0The worst part, however, was that the surge rate on uber had gone up in the time between the first car she ordered and the second, so she ended up getting charged $50 for the trip. \xa0We emailed uber back and forth several times but they have refused to reduce the charges at all even though their incorrect estimates of arrival times caused this problem and also resulted in a higher rate as she had to cancel and re-order at a later time. \xa0I will not use uber in the future. \xa0Gett, Lyft and Via are all much more reliable and affordable in my experience.",
 u"        3/4/2015    Signed up to use Uber 2/27/15, but couldn't get through. \xa0I kept getting an error message - cannot process payment method. \xa0I registered with both my payment card and google wallet. \xa0Still no avail. \xa0I contacted Uber (only reachable through their website), only to be told to send a picture of my credit card and a photo id to get security clearance.Isn't this the company that got hacked a few weeks back, and 50,000 users info exposed? \xa0Security Clearance to use an app?Already provided through sign up was my name, phone number, billing address, email address, gps, pick up and drop off location, all recordable and linked together and now you want me to send a photo id to use an app to hail a taxi?

 u'        10/14/2014    Terrible. I was charged $49 to travel from 54th St & 8th Ave in Manhattan to 19th St and Park In Manhattan. When I tried to complain about this, the ultra-douche CEO Travis personally wrote back to mock me for being upset.',
 u'        1/21/2015            Updated reviewI filed a complaint with the taxi and limos ins commission. Driver plead guilty and had to pay a fine.',
 u"        12/2/2014    I really was stuck between a 1 or 2 star rating at the beginning of this review until I made my ultimate decision. Please note: I am NOT an individual that likes taking taxis usually, cause I find them unnecessarily expensive, and I live very conveniently close to public transport, though it takes longer.My sister had a coupon for $30 off any ride using the uber service, and I was on my way to Brooklyn Thanksgiving Day waiting for the long island railroad. It seemed like a faster more relaxing option since I was bringing food over to a friend's house who's family had to go to NJ, and I didn't want to leave her along since she couldn't go. When applying the promo, it for some reason dropped down to $20 off, which was annoying, but I guess Thanksgiving fees. Fine. The guy came pretty quickly, at about the same time my train would've left if I had taken the other option. The guy was nice in the beginning, offered me gum. A man from Bangladesh, but not very talkative, which was okay. I fell asleep, and woke up close to our destination. For whatever reason, the app kept freezing and lagging on my phone, so my sis used hers to set up the ride, and she typed in the address. B/c my sister typed in ave, instead of street, we ended up in the wrong place. We got there and he was like, okay, we're here, you can get out. I'm like, no this is the wrong place, idk how to get to her from here. He was like, well, that's not my problem, it's late and a holiday, you need to get out. My friend was on the phone flipping out on the guy, so I put her volume all the the down, apologize and say, look, let me find out where she is. I checked my navigation and it said she was like 8 blocks away or so, he tried to convince me it wasn't so far, in the middle of the night, cold, carrying large trays of food and ingredients. I get it was a holiday, but I didn't make you take the shift, that was YOUR choice. It was an honest mistake on my part, and I can get being annoyed, but that's no reason to threaten leaving a [female] customer in the middle of nowhere after they state that they would be lost out here. Especially since if you drive me further, you get paid more, so idk what the big deal is. If you're taking a trip at about 7:30 on Thanksgiving night to Brooklyn from LI, I feel like you didn't have plans on a quiet evening at home anyway, you were going to work. The extra 10 mins, to get me to where I need to be wouldn't have killed you, or brought you home that much faster, since you're probably going back the the main office in queens anyway. Not to be rude or selfish, but really dude?? I basically say, look, It's about 5 mins away according to navigation, I can't make it alone, please take me. He eventually gives in and says fine, I offer up another apology and he gets me to her house in literally less than 10 mins. I ask him the fee, he says he has no clue, but it'll prolly be around $70, which after that kind of service, I'm like excuse me?? I live in LI, but I'm right on the cusp of queens, like literally 2 blocks away, so idk that it should be that much going from Queens to BK. He then laughs condescendingly, tells me to get out as I'm inquiring about the price of this bs experience, so I get out and go. The charge me $50+ after the promo and what really brought this 1 star home was the fact that after all that, every customer service number was a machine, NO representatives to talk to, no real way of contacting them on the website, no number being left, only an e-mail to contact. I'm sending them an e-mail through lost and found since that's the only way of contact I found.LONG STORY SHORT: My sister accidentally inputs wrong address (ave instead of street) for me, we end up at wrong place, driver threatens to leave me there multiple times even after I apologize and say I'm lost, even after I look up navigation that says my destination (a friend's house) is less than 8 blocks away, about 5 mins away (by car) in the middle of the night, in the freezing cold. I could've just taken the LIRR for $8 and save $50 and a headache. NEVER AGAIN. UBER is sh*t, with NO customer service. Save your time, patience, and $$$. Sh*t honestly seems like a scam, because with other cab services, NOT gypsy cabs, you can at least call their office. There is zero way to contact these people, and the number I found on the yellow pages, was someone's home phone number.",
 u'        9/8/2015    We have used Uber on several occasions when we have had to bring our 22 lb. Tibetan Spaniel with us. \xa0I might add he has never been in a carrier either. \xa0Today a driver came to pick us up after I had to give him directions twice, took 10 minutes to get to us and then refused us. \xa0Personally I think he has a religious objection to dogs, because whenever we walk by people of his ethnicity, they usually scream (adults too). \xa0Then he charged us a $5 cancellation fee because WE kept him waiting. \xa0DO NOT use UBER, we certainly will not.',
 u"        11/17/2014    Finally decided to try Uber.from Soho to LGA.Registered, input info, tapped estimate fare.Around 41$. Great.30 minutes later when time to book, the price jumped to 130$!!!!!!!!!'F. That.When outside and jumped in taxi immediately.Checked \xdcber price....now 31$.Stupid. Deleting app.",
 u'        9/11/2015    so we were 2 people standing on the sidewalk around Houston. not only did the 1st UBER driver cancelled on us and left us hanging the second one CALLED us and actually raised his voice at me asking me :"why did you put the wrong address?" when i had been standing there for the past 15-20mn. needless to say i am very disappointed at that company and will be trying lyft from now on.',
 u"        1/27/2015    \xdcber, more like Poober. Definitely had to coach my driver on how to drive to manhattan from brooklyn. Got surge gouged out the a$$ the first time and what would have been the last time, but a friend ordered one to bring some things to a job I was doing and he got gouged unwittingly on that trip which I had to take out of my work budget because I forgot to surge charge my client I guess. Sure they retort back that the multiplier is disclosed there but until you've experienced it once for yourself (now twice without meaning to.) you don't expect it. (fine print can eat a di*k)\xdcber, stop marketing to the fine people of NYC who are budget conscious. Get off my google maps and get out of the service industry.",
 u'        10/25/2015    I tried using Uber recently in New Jersey. I like the fact that their fare estimate was accurate, the fact that I did not have to call anyone to get a car and an easy to use app. What I didn\'t like was that when ordering the car once, after I hit the "request car" button, the estimate wait for a car was 10 minutes longer on the app than before hitting the button. The ride itself was great, no complaints, great cars and friendly drivers.',
 u'        2/15/2015    Love it! Feet were bleeding cold and uber saved my life. Will never flag diwn a yellow cab again',
 u'        5/30/2015    Let the Uber customer beware! First let me say that I am a big fan of Uber. I use their service quite frequently, especially in NYC. That is, until tonight... 5/29/15.I had a very questionable experience with Uber, or drivers posing as Uber, at LGA around 6pm. It started when I exited the baggage claim area, walked outside, and \xa0headed to the Taxi Stand. Over the course of the first 100 feet, I was approached 3 separate times by various men holding Uber signs. This struck me as odd because I have never witnessed Uber drivers out of their cars hawking customers on sidewalks before. As I continued to walk, they engaged me sequentially trying to make a sell. Intrigued, I asked each of them to show me their Uber credentials. However, the only credential they would share was the license plate of their car. Nothing distinct there. To further test Uber authenticity, I requested to use a different credit card than the one currently on my account. Each said, "no problem--I\'ll just swipe your new card when we arrive at your destination." This was a big warning sign! Finally, I asked one of the alleged Uber drivers to tell me how much the fare was from LGA to Mid-town? After extolling that rush hour traffic was heavy, the Manhattan tunnel was clogged, etc., he finally told me the fare was $65-$70. On the high end of high to say the least. When asked, another hawker actually linked to what appeared to what appeared to be Uber\'s Website and then showed me a fare range between $97-$123. That was totally absurd! Dumbfounded, I just kept walking to the Airport Taxi Stand, which by the way, was virtually uninhabited. Absolutely no line! I ended up taking a traditional taxi ride into Manhattan. The fare, including the tunnel toll and a 20% tip, only came to $43 all in. I certainly hope those hawkers were not actual Uber drivers. If they were, this behavior will undoubtedly erode the loyalty and trust of Uber\'s growing customer base. \xa0If they were not Uberites, then the popular ground transportation juggernaut has yet another significant business challenge to face.',
 u'        9/8/2015    Uber is a deceptive service. I was charged an unauthorized fee of $200 on a $20 trip from upper manhattan into the Bronx. The service makes it extremely difficult to contact them and I have yet to get a refund.',
 u"        5/29/2015    Was truly disappointed with uber's customer service. We downloaded the app and set location for pickup. Waited approx 8 min and could see the car was close. Called the driver and apparently he had car troubles, he stated that he had an issue with his tire. I understand that we have all had car troubles at one point but I had to call him and ask where he was. I would think if he was having car trouble he would call us and let us know or call for another car to pick us up, apparently \xfcber does not do either one. I was told by NYC cab driver that \xfcber will sometimes accept the ride and it won't show your destination and if they don't like the area you are needing to go to they will make up some excuse and in this case the excuse was that he was having car troubles. Would not recommend using uber for long distances such as a trip from Manhattan to JFK.",
 u"        9/27/2015    Zero stars rate stated 38.00 shared ride to JFK .Driver picked up no other passengers. I was charged 114.00 price .A NYC taxi would have been 68.00. My driver Sukhbir Singh a obnoxious rude theif , if you see is name run in the other direction. I will never use them again .And will repot to BBB. \xa0I would give them 0 stars , but wasn't a choice.",
 u"        5/20/2015    I used uber for the first time in new york, thinking it couldn't be more than a taxi. I was wrongly mistaken. I had to pay a surcharge because it was premium time... REALLY!! My ride was simply from the airport to the hotel and it was $95.00 dollars. I was never informed on the amount until we were dropped off. Taxi has a flat rate of $60.00. Needless to say, I will never be using uber again. We used a shuttle to get back to the airport which only cost is $17.50 each.",
 u"        10/11/2014    The ride from Financial district to east village was $32 which is unreasonable. Please save your money and never use uber. It's a rip off",
 u"        4/1/2015    UBER has it down to an art. Fast, safe, reasonable rates and polite drivers. It's the ONLY app that I'll use, and recommend. The GPS alerts you when your driver has arrived.",
 u'        3/30/2015    I order car service to JFK airport and LaGuardia pretty frequently. And UBER is Great option only if UBERX is available. Overall this company sucks. Lyft is way better',
 u'        11/13/2014    I scheduled a car to pick up coworker at 35th and 6th Ave last night. I was watching the car approach 34th and had been in touch with the driver who told me there was traffic (expected) where he was...not a problem. All of a sudden he cancelled the trip...a block away. I went back into the app and scheduled another car, now at 2.5x for surge pricing. Obviously the first driver became aware of the surge pricing and went to grab a more expensive fare, leaving me to pay $63 for a trip from Herald Square to the Brooklyn Marriott. Uber should have provided the ride at the original price instead of gouging. I am very seriously considering deleting this app and never using Uber again. UPDATE: I received an email from Angie at Uber, saying that they are going to refund my surge pricing of $38, which is what they *should* do. I am upgrading my stars for Uber as a result of their response.',
 u'        2/4/2015    The Rides i received with Uber we nice and comfortable but when I applied a coupon code for $30 off my ride, it never worked. I was instead charged full price for the ride. It was my first ride and experience and it really irked me in a bad way. I doubt if i will use this service again. Ive seen better deals from competitors and I may have to use their services next time.',
 u'        7/14/2015    Never ever use this "service". \xa0This "business" is the king of unethical business practices. \xa0They charge exponentially more than even yellow taxis. \xa0Carmel is right Uber is a gigantic scam and the people of New York should support legislation to disallow this "business" to operate in our city.',
 u"        10/11/2015    I rather take a taxi for the same fare as it's fully insured. I don't see why we need to pay same taxi fare for a private own car who do not pay City Taxes for car services.",
 u'        12/13/2014    Terrible, I started using uber in Washington DC and I was very satisfied. Then, I used in Paris and there was no difference in the price between a regular cab and Uber. I still gave them a chance, and I told my dad about it who used it when he was in NYC to go the JFK. He does\xb4t speak english and he didn\xb4t understand that his price will double and he accepted. He found his self paying $125 to the airport. It\xb4s ridiculous, he could\xb4ve take a cab and not have to pay that price. Of course, the customer service wrote to me the same thing on the help center as I am stupid and I could not go read it by myself one I found out about my dad trip.I will never use them although I never had a problem with them in DC',
 u"        7/25/2015    Below, is the email I have sent to uber explaining my nightmare of a situation I have been in. I have still not received a response and I am still missing 54 dollars. I would just like to reiterate the hassle and frustration that has occurred since the first and last time I attempted to utilize the Uber app. Being a college student, my funds are very limited and the miniscule income I do have, I meticulously plan and allocate every penny to the growing bills and expenses I have each month. Once $54.00 was charged to my account unknowingly, it created a much bigger headache than a wrongful charge to one's account already is. Reoccurring payments I have on a cycle to be paid each month that are automatically deduced from my account did not process because of my insufficient funds as a result of UBER'S mistake. I then had to run to the bank to deposit more money to avoid an overdraft charge. Additionally, I have taken had to take more of my valuable time sending countless emails (see below), to your company, and as of today, the $54.00 is STILL not in my account. I don't know what kind of business takes an individual's credit card, and haphazardly charges money to it that does not justify the services used. Then, I have not one, but two representatives Emailing me, using incorrect names, and inevitably telling me to deal with the problem myself, thus causing me to spend even more time on the phone with my bank; all because I wanted to take a UBER ride. It is suffice to say that myself, nor the many friends that value my opinion, will ever download your app, get in your car, or give you our credit card information. From start to finish, this entire process has been despicable, and this correspondence will not be the only place I voice my experience.",
 u'        7/16/2015    Called a cab for a friend from midtown to bayside queens. Came out to almost $100 because the driver decided to go from midtown to the Bronx around city island and back to queens. When I emailed uber about it they said the route was correct. I emailed them a google maps and mapquest directions and still they said the driver was correct.',
 u"        3/18/2015    I've used uber in my time in NY and I have had mixed experiences. My first time was wonderful, no hassle at all. The second time my ride didn't even show up. And I didn't want to have leave a bad review based on one time so I did use it a third time, and this time the ride showed up - however, the guy who picked me up was 13 minutes late and drove very recklessly. Proceed with caution when it comes to Uber.",
 u"        11/29/2014    1 check-in        This was my first time using Uber and I have to say it was a cool experience.My sister actually showed me how to use it and there was a $25 off promo code for first time users so we didnt pay anything.The Uber thing said our driver would be there in 1 minute but it was actually 15 seconds! His name was Roman & he was really,really nice & professional.When we got in he had really cool techno music playing but it wasn't obnoxious techno,it was that cool techno that you can just listen to the beat & it sounds good but it doesn't annoy the crap out of you.It wasn't turned up really loud,it was just right so we could chit chat & listen to the music in the background.He was really courteous & got us to our destination very quick.Uber is linked to my Paypal account so everything is safe, quick & easy to do. and \xa0you can even split the total fare with 4 people if you want.The cars are also always really nice, clean & classy looking.I will never take a cab again, Uber all the way!",
 u"        7/10/2015    I'm giving it one star because it won't let me put 0 this was way too expensive with a surcharge of $27 wtf is a surcharge and how do they get away with this. I had to call my driver 4 times because he passed my building 4 times. That made me 30 min late to where I needed to be. \xa0He said he didn't know where my building was ugh don't they have GPS and why don't it work better. I will stick to my yellow nyc cabs thank you.......",
 u"        1/28/2016    too many new,unknown drivers..unknown where there going !! for the same money I just flag the old yellow dinosaurs..at least they don't get lost....",
 u'        3/22/2015    Its really dumb to wait 4 uber amateur drivers when 50 yellow cabs r passing by who know how to get places specially \xa0in nyc i always had horrible experience with uber they charge u more and they lie that they r cheaper than yellow cab',
 u'        7/17/2015    Tried to get Uber for trip to CT. \xa02 cars accepted the trip and both proceeded to; -tell us they went to a different location "accidentally"; - would be at correct location in 3/4 minutes; - proceeded to cancel trip. \xa0The first car charged $10 on credit card, so I have to deal with that now. \xa0Had to scramble to take taxi to Grand Central Station and then wait for train at 5:13pm rush hour. \xa0A taxi driver or livery car would not be able to get away with this. \xa0Uber sucked in this area. \xa0Unfortunate situation because Uber from CT was an awesome experience and awesome driver.',
 u'        1/7/2015            Updated reviewI am writing an update to my earlier post, where I was upset about two separate charges.. After writing in to their customer support, I was pleasantly surprised by the quick responses to both of my trip issues, and the full refund for my non-attended trip as well as partial refund for the surge trip. The customer service was understanding and quick to act, and I really appreciated it. The surge policies continue to baffle me, but because of the good customer service, I would consider taking another ride with Uber, but be sure to double check my estimated fare.',
 u'        2/12/2015    Absolutely ridiculous. I paid more using Uber than a taxi or Carmel Limo. Using Carmel Limo from now on when taking a cab from Manhattan to any airport. NEVER using Uber in New York again.',
 u"        1/28/2015    Used Uber for the first time the other day and I can't say that I will use it regularly but definitely for those panicky times when I need a ride and don't have time to stand on the street trying to flag down a cab it's perfect. I know that the price was fair because I've taken this trip before several times and this time actually came out less than most others. I was able to communicate with my driver before he arrived and was ready. He was very nice and polite.",
 u'        8/10/2015    First ride great then next two attempts took way too long \xa0for car to find us. Our third driver just canceled our trip. NYC may be too congested and difficult for uber drivers',
 u'        6/25/2015    There is not a way posted here to give a no star rating.Uber in New Jersey broke the law, ignored the ADA (American Disabilities Act), and demonstrated total disrepect toward a decorated, wounded warrior and his service dog. The driver refused to let them enter the vehicle because "he didn\'t like dogs." REALLY? This disrepectful and despicable treatment of our wounded warriors and all those who suffer from invisible or visible disabilites needs to stop. Capt. Montalvan was in New Jersey and on his way to his presentation at a local library. Because of the driver\'s actions, the event was cancelled, which resulted in a disappointed group of children who were anxiously awaiting Capt Montalvan and his service dog, a frustrated staff who had worked so hard coordinating the event, \xa0Capt Montalvan\'s loss of his speaker\'s fee, not to mention the tremendous emotional distress placed upon him as this dreadful experience unravelled.This treatment of our veterans is inexcusable and I am hoping that Uber will educate all of their employees, everywhere, as to the laws and rights pertaining to the disabled and service animals. I would also hope that Uber would present the library and its staff with an apology and, most importantly, apologize to Capt Montalvan for the employee\'s behavior and compensate him monetarily for his lost honorarium and any other expenses he incurred in connection with the forced cancellation. This is a serious issue.......educate yourselves and your employees!',
 u'        6/20/2015    After booking Uber for the first time, I called the driver so that I can find out what size vehicle that I was getting because there were 4 of us. The driver did not pick up after many rings, so I decided not to take a chance of running late and took a taxi instead. While enroute in a taxi, the Uber driver called me and I told him that he was too late and I had to take a taxi. I then saw that I was charged $8 for nothing. I believe it was after 5 minutes therefore I could not cancel the Uber vehicle. Can you please refund me the $8 that I lost? If I am refunded, I will know that Uber takes care of their members, otherwise I will never use them again.. After complaining to yelp, within hours, the issue was fixed. Apparently, the driver inadvertently pressed the wrong button therefore charging my account.',
 u"        11/28/2014    I have been a huge Uber advocate since nearly day 1 but it has gone downhill lately. How on earth can you employ people that don't know anything about the areas where they drive? In the last 2 weeks I have been picked up in Hoboken 3 times and the drivers had no idea how to get to the following: 1) The PATH!! 2) Newark Airport 3) Manhattan!!At least in the 3rd case the driver asked for directions. The first 2 times they just started driving. I guess they were hoping to just get lucky. I never thought I would go back to regular taxis but I'm getting close. Get it together Uber.",
 u'        12/18/2014    I used Uber to go 1.5 miles to the subway station. \xa0We happened to get behind a bus and had to respect the law and stop as a child boarded. \xa0It took a while and that resulted in a $17 RIDE! \xa0We were 3 blocks from the train, had i known it would be so costly i would have jumped out and walked it. \xa0This ride is normally $8-$9. \xa0Again 1.5 miles. \xa0If I had used a local car service I would not have been so incredibly over-charged.',
 u'        11/17/2014    Last Saturday one of the two teachers who coach a middle school debate team in a program I oversee took a cab from Harlem to 33rd street and First Avenue in Manhattan for about $20. On the way home she and another teacher who lives near her in Harlem used Uber to go back to Harlem. To their chagrin, they were charged $63 for the same trip (they showed me the receipts). Need I say more!',
 u"        4/19/2015    It was a great idea from Uber to offer $5 rides along the L train route.... That is until this offer got very busy (duh) and all of a sudden the rate doubled. \xa0That was last night. \xa0This morning is still a raised price. \xa0Classic bait and switch Uber, especially after you stated that pricing will not change with demand. \xa0Thankfully there are other service options like Gett.com who honor No Surge Pricing and don't limit the ride to 2 passengers. \xa0Very poor business Uber.",
 u"        5/5/2015    This cant be legal: Uber suspended my account (said that my bank didn't verify something) and then said to reactivate my account I'd have to send a photo of my credit card (first 12 numbers blacked out or covered somehow) and my photo ID. Excuse me? You want me to send you my photo ID? For what? I already know that you can access my debit card number and expiration date and now I should give you my ID? Do you not realize that this is enough information for a half-smart person to steal customers' identity? Are you freaking kidding me? This can't be legal.",
 u'        3/1/2015    My issue with Uber is their 2.4x up charge about 3 weeks ago when I was heading to JFK. \xa0I was under the impression that I would save a few dollars by hiring Uber but instead I got charged $125 at the end! \xa0Normally from my office in Midtown to JFK it only costs $70. \xa0I emailed Uber about it to see if they can drop the price a little but they refused to do so. \xa0That was my 1st and last time using Uber.',
 u'        12/1/2015    Is it possible to give no stars? This is a report I sent to uber about my experience with one of their drivers: Uber driver was not a destination location instead he was parked across the street not able to see where I was. I stood outside for 4mins waiting in the rain until I noticed the vehicle i then proceeded to Walk across the street. once I got into the vehicle I immediately asked the driver why wouldn\'t he pick me up where my pick up was set up and he responded it was a Resturant but clearly there was a building by the Resturant that you would clearly notice if you actually went on the block. I told him that is not the service customers sign up for when contacting uber, the purpose is to be picked up on time on location to make our lives easier & he rudely responded "can u get out my car Miss" and I said "okay that\'s fine I want you to cancel this trip" and he said "i\'ll do it when You get out" but I know that there would be a 10$ charge so I said no you need to do it while I\'m here so that I know it was handled correctly and he responded and said I guess your not in a rush and i replied no I\'m not actually, I can\'t wait for you to cancel my card before I leave because regardless if you don\'t want to take me or not MY card will be charged a service fee. He said nothing and then started the car and started driving then I said sir where are you going and he said "since you don\'t want to get out I am driving" I said excuse me can you just cancel my card and he ignored me and then purposely let out gas as a sign of disrespect to me being I was right behind him. He drove away from my pick up location to let me out on a random block. He \xa0 got out his car and opened the door and starts screaming "get the fuck out my car" repeatedly at this point I calmly asked him again to cancel this trip and return my funds and he ignored and carried on so I called the police to hear what was going on because at this point I don\'t know what he was going to do. I spoke to the operator on the phone to let her know that I will get out the car and wait for a cab. Not only did he threaten me but I feel COMPLETELY disrespected and disappointed in this service by uber.',
 u"        6/30/2015    I'm a little shocked to see such an overwhelming amount of negative reviews about Uber. I've been a member for about a year and thank god I've had NOTHING but pleasant experiences, outside of one cab driver who had no idea where he was going because his gps died. I'm mainly writing the review about a particular Driver, Hussian, which if I knew him personally as a driver I'd use all the time. He picked up my friend, son and I in a uberpool (max 2 ppl) because reg Ubers were not available in our area, drove us in the rain from the Bronx to crown heights Brooklyn, with baby gear, boxes and purses in tote. Got out the vehicle with an umbrella, held the doors open for us, helped us pack our belongings in the truck and then some. I wrote to uber personally about my experience to give him not 5 but 6 stars, and just thought I had to share my experince here as well. Btw in case anyone uses Lyft as a secondary option for cab service, they are dreadful and the app is garbage, Uber is way better.",
 u'        2/11/2015    I am only rating 1 star because I have to, otherwise I would rate 0 stars. Honestly, I will walk before I ever use Uber again. I had a few positive experiences when I was first recommended to install the Uber app on my phone by a friend. But then, my husband and I used the car service to go to a cocktail event just over the Brooklyn bridge and were charged $85.00 before tip. What???? To go to Brooklyn? Then, rubbing salt into the wound, we booked a car to go back to meet friends in Manhattan, and it took about 5 minutes to get our coats. When we came out, we saw our Uber car down the block, NOT in front of the venue, and he was picking up people who flagged him down on the street. We were told by text there was nothing they could do, so we had to take the subway back to Manhattan. The company did nothing to compensate us for the horrific customer service and Uber has left a very bad taste in my mouth. We have used other car services and have never been treated this way. There have been issues but not like this. I will use any other car service and I will NEVER use Uber again. I have deleted the app from my phone and have nothing good to say about this company. They know nothing about customer service.',
 u'        5/7/2015    Last night I had the Uber experience from hell. I asked for a pickup from Roosevelt Island, heading to Astoria. Uber driver Gurpreet (4.6*) took the job. After 10 minutes, I checked my phone and saw that Gurpreet was driving in the wrong direction, heading back over the 59th street bridge towards NYC. I called him and politely informed him that I was 20-30 minutes away at this point, and asked for a cancellation. Gurpreet refused and told me I had to cancel and pay the $10 cancellation fee. I refused and asked again for him to cancel. He then proceed to curse at me, hung up the phone, and used the Uber app to "pick me up" and proceeded to drive around NYC and towards Long Island for an hour. At this point I walked home, and cancelled the trip when I got to Astoria. Uber charged me $61. I had to call my credit card and put holds on all charges. Uber has NO phone support. They answered 1 email but have been unresponsive since. Please stay away from Uber driver Gurpreet.',
 u'        5/10/2015    What a horrible company. They do not have published phone number zero customer service and they price gauge.

 u"        10/5/2014    First to Review        Terrible company. I am at a work event, outside of a bar, my colleague is feeling light headed and like she is going to faint. We try to help her the best we can but ultimately it is time for her to go home. I offer to take an UBER with her to see she gets home safe. I get out my phone and try to book one on the app. It won't accept the payment info I previously had in there, no clue why but it's definitely not due to insufficient funds. I quickly try to add another credit card. Again it won't accept it. I try to add Paypal, which includes numerous attempts at password recovery's. Again it won't accept it. My friend is getting worse. She sets up the UBER on her phone. It says it's 4 minutes away. We watch the car go many different ways to get to us. It comes close, then goes further away, then close, then further away. After 11 minutes she calls the driver. He is almost to us he says. A few minutes later he shows up. We drive to the FDR to go from midtown manhattan to Brooklyn and he pulls over before it. His GPS isn't working on his iphone that the \xfcber app is connected to. He ends the ride by sliding the red bar on his iphone by accident. He doesn't realize though. He needs to know how to get there. He reaches under his passenger side seat to get an old Garmon gps out, hands it to her so she can enter her address. It isn't working. She can't type on this old thing. I take over. I can't type on this old thing. I tell him to do it. He pulls out his old flip phone and asks her to call him so his Iphone can connect with her again. We don't understand why. She does it and it doesn't work. After about 5 minutes we get out and get a cab. The cab ride was the worst and cost us $30. He doesn't get on the FDR but instead drives through the city streets in major traffic to get downtown to the bridge, \xa0he drives fast and aggressive like a scene from the dukes of hazard. At one point my bum lifts from the seat as he goes fast over a bump. Finally we are both home. I contact \xfcber about the issue with my payment woes a few days later. They want me to print bank statements, cross out my account numbers, scan them with a copy of my drivers license and email it to them. I refuse to do all this work and to send my confidential info over email. My friend gets charged for the ride to the FDR and I vow never to use \xfcber again. Banned!",
 u"        10/19/2014    I live in Los Angeles and love using Uber there. Fares are at least 50% cheaper than taxis. What a disappointment to come to New York and find no savings whatsoever. In fact, probably more expensive. A 3 mile Uber ride Friday night was over 26.00. I did agree to being charged 1.5 times regular rate, but that is still 18.00 for a 3 mile ride. Yesterday I did a fare estimate to get from Lower Manhattan to my hotel. Uber came back at 13.00-18.00. I then took a regular cab and it was 12.00! I don't understand how this service can be so different in 2 major cities. Will never use in NY again.",
 u'        5/30/2015    I had two Uber rides in Manhattan in three days. Both were outstanding. Friendly drivers, very clean cars, safe driving, and because I requested a shared ride (no other customers were looking for Uber cars at that time so it still was solo), the price was cheaper than a yellow cab. Esepcially when the drivers refused an offered tip. They arrived within 5 minutes as promised and I especially liked having their picture and the vehicle picture and the license info before I entered the car. I am not a nervous traveler, but I am an older woman who travels alone and the extra safe-guards were a real plus for me.',
 u"        4/11/2015    Has anyone had problems with uber lately? \xa0I had 2 successive rides where I felt very unsafe with the driver. And then today I contacted the driver and when he found out my destination, he hung up on me. ( My destination was midtown on the east side.) I am concerned that driver's are not being properly screened for driving skills and experience. NYC cabs are beginning to look better!",
 u"        2/28/2015    If I could give this company no stars I would. I'm a pretty understanding person if something doesn't go according to plan. However if it happen more then once then there's a problem. Uber is the worst taxi company and would never, never, ever use their services again. I'm sticking with my yellow cabs for now on. At least I know what I'm getting in the end result. My cab ride that I schedule was taking me to Brooklyn, he proceeded to take battery tunnel to drive all through Brooklyn and pass it to then go to queens just to make his way back into Brooklyn. This was a ridiculous drive and even after the fact that I pointed out why is he driving in the opposite direction my driver took it upon himself to ignore me. Towards the end of my trip I then had to forcefully tell him how to get to my destination. The end result an $80 dollar cab ride that should have been $40 dollars tops and a 30-35 mins cab ride that turned into an 90 min ride. Uber in general is the worst b/c the site does not let u cancel membership, you have to submit a request through email and you're not able to delete your credit card information. And to make matters worse the company does not have a direct contact number. I ask people that do not want to get hustle out of their hard earned money do not use uber!!!!!",
 u'        3/4/2015    I have used the Uber service once. It was very worthwhile, when considering that I was able to get a first-time user discount. Without that reduction, the fare would not have been competitive at all with regular car service rides. I requested a Uber Pool ride, from my home in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to the Chelsea area of Manhattan. Instead, a car arrived, and the driver said that I\'d be the only passenger. He said that the "pool" option doesn\'t usually work, and it may take a long time to match up with other customers. Although I live about 15 blocks from the Williamsburg bridge, this Uber driver took me up through Queens to the Midtown Tunnel. Obviously, that\'s a toll route, where as the bridge is free. There\'s also more traffic exiting the tunnel on the Manhattan side. The driver drove straight across 23rd Street, where Kanye West was doing an outdoor performance, \xa0and we got stuck in all that grid lock. All in all, it took a really long time to get to Chelsea, which is only a few miles. Livery car drivers always take the free (and direct) route into Manhattan, and they would never have got us stuck on 23rd Street, since the path of least resistance is to go north along the west side. I really doubt that I will use Uber again.',
 u"        11/6/2014    Today was the first time i used UBER and I was really excited to do so. Little did i know what was going to happen next. After I was dropped off at the location I was hopeful because the ride had been fast, faster than expected, the driver was courteous and affable and the fare estimate the application provided seemed reasonable. Once at my destination and after the driver left, i received an email with my receipt 30 minutes later showing that the trip had kept going for an additional 40+ miles and for an additional half an hour. My card ended getting charged almost $100 more than what it should have been charged for the trip. The most distressing part about this whole situation is that I have sent message after message (Ohh there's no customer support number!) all afternoon today asking that this be rectified or at least for someone to contact me so that we may take care of this \xa0matter and after more than 4 hours trying to get an answer from a human, i haven't even gotten an automated message providing me with even an acknowledgment that anyone is trying to do something about this. \xa0I will certainly delete The application from my phone and never use them again!",
 u'        2/10/2015    You suck \xfcber. My bf had to go to JFK for a business trip. They told my bf they would pick up in 20 min. Then 15 min later they canceled the pick. Canceled!! I have never heard a cab company canceling 5 minutes before their pick up time. He had to scramble looking for another cab company that would pick him up right away. If it was t for this other cab company he would have missed his flight. No way will we ever call \xfcber again expecially not for a time sensitive trip to airport.',
 u"        4/12/2015    Uber black is the best service imaginable. Brilliant concept, excellent drivers and the convenient app make this easily \xa0a 5- star company. I've had accounts with radio car services as well as hired my own private drivers - nothing compares to the consistent high quality of uber black. I only use uber x when black cars aren't available and though it's cheaper, the service isn't as good. Most days uber black is available and I never need to wait more than 7 minutes for a car, uber black drivers are fantastic 95% of the time. The cars are always clean, comfortable and new. Honestly uber black is pretty much perfection.",
 u'        11/13/2014    Worst experience ever!!!!! The surge price is insane!!!!! I got charged 120 dollars for a 6 mile drive!!!! And even worse, there is no customer service at all to complain!!!! Worst app I have ever seen! Will never use Uber and definitely tell all my friends not using it anymore if they cannot give my money back!!!',
 u"        4/9/2015            Updated reviewRecently left a pretty negative review due to a bad experience with an Uber pickup and charge. I've changed my review because the response to resolve my problem and the follow up were handle incredibly well.",
 u"        11/9/2014    I tried to like Uber. I love the idea of it. I even had a free ride promotion. But after waiting for the uber driver for over 15 minutes and having him call me 3 times and not understand where I was, and after the driver not being able to speak English or understand English, I got a car through the hotel to the airport. Not sure I'll ever use Uber again. If they can't find where I am from the navigation system, what good are they?",
 u'        1/13/2015    I travel alot for my acting work and in every city I\'ve been a very loyal customer to Uber, with mostly okay results. But my latest trip was REALLY upsetting in terms of how disloyal, I feel, Uber has been in response to me as their customer. UberPool. Proceed with caution folks. They have been pushing it in emails and on the app. It states that if you get a match they GUARANTEE a notably discounted ride for the inconvenience of only a few added minutes. Jan 5th, I decided that instead of taking my usual subway trip home from JFK (which i don\'t mind cause it\'s affordable), I\'d give their UberPool a chance and share the normal $60 or so fare with another rider. I figured I could afford 30 bucks to get home on the freezing night I arrived. Had I ANY idea that I\'d get stuck paying almost $70 I NEVER would\'ve taken the chance cause I do not have that kind of extra money.But, loyal customer, I tapped the UberPool in the app and waited to hear if I got a match. After a few minutes, i did! I was ecstatic. My driver called and coordinated where to pick me up. I went outside with my big suitcase and waited in the freeze till he found me. He was very kind when he did and loaded me into the car. Where\'s the other rider? I asked. He said we were gonna pick her up right away and called her, but she didn\'t pick up. He called again. And again. We sat in the car for almost ten to fifteen minutes, and he kept calling her. Finally she answered and said that she\'d gotten a notice from the Uber app that the ride had been cancelled, so she got a yellowcab home. So I\'m thinking, Uhhhhh... what\'s that mean for me? It said if I got a match I was guaranteed a discounted fare, soooo...... And by this point the airport cops had kept trying to get our car to move so they had ushered us away from my initial pickup point. I asked were we gonna get another driver cause I really didn\'t sign up for a private car or the price of one. The driver tried to find a match but after even longer of waiting, he could not, and was very kind, but said that I would have to pay for the ride and take it up with Uber. What to do? It\'s now almost 20-25 minutes later, it\'s freezing, we\'ve pulled well away from the terminal and the other taxis and buses. I felt kinda stuck with a trip whose full cost I didn\'t sign up for, but I was confident Uber would give me a refund equivalent to the split cost. I was, after all, one other their loyal customers. I\'d gone out on a limb trusting them and tried their new initiative. And the mixup was no fault of my own. So they\'d do what was right, right? Wrong. I sent them an email only to get a shocking FIVE DOLLARS credit. $5 credit on a $65 ride?! And ONLY for UberPool, the service that screwed me over the first time. What the heck?I\'m stunned they could not knock even thirty bucks my way to correct a shitty situation for a loyal customer. Very disappointed to not feel more valued. Emails below. I\'ll update if they write again and decide that aaaaaaaall my business is indeed worth more than 5 bucks.MY EMAIL:"Hello,I\'m a loyal and longtime uber customer and, at the urgence of the uber email I received about Uber\'s new UberPool initiative, I took a chance to try the new service when returning home to NYC at JFK airport on 1-5-15.I would normally take the bus home, but at the offer by uber that the pooling service could slash the ride cost, I decided to try it.An uber driver accepted my request, and called to say I had an UberPool and he would pick me up soon. He did, but AFTER I got in the car with all my luggage, we waited for about ten minutes while he tried to reach the other participant. Finally he got her and she said shed received some message from her uber app that her ride was canceled so she got a yellow cab. I asked the driver if we could find another person to pool and he said no one else was calling in. So I ended up shouldering the WHOLE $65 cost myself which was not what I signed up for at all. If I thought that would happen I wouldn\'t have tried it. I would really like something back for this ride I got stuck with (through, it seems, no fault of my own) OR accredit for a future ride.Again I\'ve been a VERY loyal customer in every city I\'ve traveled to and I hope Uber can make this disappointing situation right.Thank you."THEIR RESPONSE:"Hi,Thanks for reaching out about uberPOOL. We\'ll always do our best to connect you with another rider who has a similar route. If for any reason there isn\'t a match made and you end up riding solo, your ride will be priced at the normal uberX rate.I understand that there was a cancellation from the 2nd rider, so I\'ve credited your account with $5 that will only be discounted off your next ride with UberPOOL.Your feedback helps us improve the uberPOOL experience, so please let us know if you have any additional questions or comments.Uber Support"',
 u"        3/6/2015    Never rode your service. But your driver, license plate T635115c, almost hit my car because he's driving like a douche. Train your drivers better.",
 u'        2/14/2015    Used them 4 times in NYC.. One was a complete fraud, not even a Uber cab. Gouged on price every time.. Would be careful using them in NYC',
 u'        2/26/2015    Used Uber black and suv while in NYC. Fares were a little more then a \xa0cab. But the ride and the drivers were better. Just pay attention to the surge prices. We did not use them at that time. Made for a nice drop off at the Majestic theater. Uber drive took us to airport as well.',
 u"        3/4/2015    Brilliant concept well executed. No hassle and generally cheaper than a taxi. When outside of the city, particularly in the outer boroughs \xa0it's the best (and sometimes only) choice.",
 u"        2/17/2015    Although I had heard the hype about Uber, I had not used them until today. When my car service to the airport cancelled on me, I thought I'd give them a shot-- I'm so glad I did! Very efficient and easy to use. I did accidentally get charged for using a car that no-showed but customer service refunded me within a few hours. Thanking Uber for making my flight today!",
 u'        11/7/2014    The absolute worst. \xa0App does not work. Sends drivers to wrong address. Yellow cabs win.',
 u"        12/25/2014    Uber surge is a ripoff. \xa0Consistently drivers take the longer more traffic laden routes to pad the bill. \xa0Google out the route first and DO NOT trust the drivers. \xa0Insist that they follow your instructions. \xa0I didn't give one star because they get a point for convenience.",
 u"        3/9/2015    I still don't understand why this business is running AND thriving. Its practices are dishonest and completely unfair to the consumer. Not only do they lack a customer service phone number and deal with all of their queries via email, but their policies are completely unfair. I was trying to get from JFK to Manhattan with Uber Pool. My driver comes and I ask if there is are other riders included in the pool. He says there are not. I said I do not want to ride unless there are people to split the fare with me. The driver tries to convince me to still ride with him even though there are no other riders around for the carpool. I told him I want to cancel and he says I shouldn't because I will have to pay a fee. He then tells me to go look for people, which I decide might be a good idea. No one wants to uberpool, so I cancel the ride. I am charged a $10 cancellation fee just for this. Even though it is UbEr's responsibility. If they don't find me someone to share a ride with, I should not be penalized for canceling the ride. That is a coercion tactic to make me ride with them either way. That is terrible practice towards consumers. I ended up downloading Lyft and taking a ride to the city for a fraction of UbEr's cost. I totally support alternatives to uber now. Uber is evil!",
 u'        3/2/2015    I have emailed uber at least 5 times as the uber I took drove us for all of 10 minutes if that and there was no surcharge...his phone died and then I was charged for him going all the way to Brooklyn for 126.00 while I was not even in the car. they have yet to contact me to rectify the situation and I find this absolutely redic as it is almost impossible to get in touch with uber. this was an error on the driver and their part and nobody has tried to fix it!!!',
 u"        1/24/2015    False estimates and drivers take longer routes. Most don't know their way around the city. Rip off !!!",
 u"        1/24/2015    I'm pretty new to Uber but I'm very pleased. The cars are very clean, driver's are professional, and I love the fact that the tip is already included in the price. There is an $8 minimum, so if you are going very nearby you may be better with a yellowcab, otherwise Uber is the same, or I find even cheaper. Great app too.",
 u"        2/23/2015    Avoid using UBER pool from JFK international airport. The drivers do not pick up their passengers. Shady low down drivers in NYC. Especially, when picking up from the airport. Uber pool is fantastic in San Francisco. Piss poor in New York City. Save yourself time and get a yellow taxi. Don't freeze to death waiting for a driver that won't pick you up and cancel by lying, saying he can't find you. Bullshit. I hope they fire all they piece of shit drivers. Seems like anyone can drive for uber in NYC. Quality control please!",
 u'        2/13/2015    I took an Uber last evening from 46th and 6th to 107 and Broadway. \xa0They never gave me a price for the ride but asked if I would pay 2.3X. The cost of my ride was $39.47. What a total rip off. Think twice before using Uber.',
 u"        1/26/2015    I have been an Uber Rider for over a year now, and have had mixed experiences with different drivers which I have fed back at the time. Recently I was asked to provide Uber Support with my passport and/or driver's license via email to verify my identity. This made me feel very uncomfortable due to privacy issues, especially in light of several recent attacks upon female riders. When I asked to speak to someone at Uber about this further (ideally in their fraud department), their support contacts have not responded to me... I am not sure where to go from here but this experience has been incredibly unprofessional and confronting.",
 u'        10/11/2014    outstanding! \xa0Used the Uber service recently to transport my wife and I from Hilton Home2 Suites in Long Island City to JFK. \xa0Outstanding customer service by the driver- prompt, efficient and cordia! \xa0WAY BETTER SUPPORT THAN NYC SUPER SHUTTLE (different review, very bad experience). \xa0Requested and received the Uber SUV due to the amount of luggage we were hauling back home (5 pieces). \xa0I highly recommend Uber for your NYC airport to/from Hotel transportation needs. \xa0Rated Uber a 4 star out of 5 - only because of the pricing structure......price charged can fluctuate based on demand and availability - if you take a regular taxi, you know the price up front from the jump...not so clear using the Uber App (1st time using it, obtw). \xa0Easily overcome with some customer education tips - maybe I missed something in the App that actually displays the total price similar to a taxi cab meter. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0But, since the ride was very pleasant despite turnpike traffic, no worries and was not a showstopper for me.',
 u"        12/8/2014    my first experience was ok. the driver was great, friendly & knowledgable, but i received only $10 off instead of the promised $30 for my first ride. (an Uber glitch i guess? & good luck finding a way to contact Uber directly, customer service number? this is extremely frustrating and unprofessional). While in NYC we used the service 4 more times. 3 of which worked out all right, the drivers came quickly.but the 4th ride was unfortunate. our driver took awhile & i think there was confusion regarding which side of the street we were on, so we'll let that slide, perhaps he was frustrated about having to circle the block in order to pick us up, not sure...?having been to our destination before, i asked why we were passing the front entrance to the hotel, he didn't have a clear answer, he went a block past & circled around, letting us out by a side door into a huge hole of black ice, where i fell and cut my knee. so let's just say i wasn't thrilled with ride #4. I will call uber in the morning to take us to JFK because i like the convenience of using the phone app, knowing how close they are & charging my account for the ride. but still OUCH!",
 u'        10/19/2014    Took uber black to jfk. \xa0The driver was angry we did not tip him. \xa0My understanding is the tip was included. \xa0Just will use a normal black car service in the future.',
 u'        11/9/2014    My review is based purely as a passenger- not the person who was charged for the ride or the one who had to call for the car. That said, the two rides we had were prompt and friendly. Their cars were brand new, clean and clearly marked so we knew we were getting into the right car, and not just any GMC. My sister had called and paid for both rides- she was a little less enthused as i guess the charge was somewhat more than it "should" have been. She has used it in NYC and LA without much issue. For as infrequently as I would need it, I don\'t know that I would download the app, but they worked perfectly for our night out.',
 u'        10/21/2014    THIS REVIEW IS FROM A DRIVER STANDPOINT (NOT CUSTOMERS) : so getting Uber as a driver is a huge headache, I am affiliated with a different base at the Moment and that is my main one, you go in, fill out paperwork & they basically issue you a phone (JOB DEVICE) and I found that they have technical issues for these phones on a Mass scale, they tell you to resolve any issues with "Tech service" over text messaging and they don\'t have an actual person or number to voice dial, it took me 3 times of actually driving into their base and addressing this issue for me to actually get them to switch my device & not only was it exhausting and annoying but they sent me out of there telling me "it should be all good now".......well it was not ! & for those of you that know about the free $500 - after your 1st 20 trips well DESPITE THEM GIVING ME A FAULTY PHONE & I HAD NOT, COULD NOT BEGIN TO WORK THEY COUNTED A DAY ALREADY WHICH MIND YOU IS AMONG THE DAYS I HAD "TECHNICAL" ISSUES I honestly think they are a good service ONCE you are done with the starting up phase, but the techs & reps they have are not very helpful especially a guy named "Chad" & the people in the basement at the base.',
 u"        3/16/2015    I've used Uber MANY times in the past 1-2 years, and only recently started having issues. They are really just hiring anyone now and it's ruining the quality once associated with the brand. I live in NYC and almost always had a clean car and nice driver pick me up through UberX and now it seems like they are hiring anyone of the streets, and are more similar to the yellow taxis that I was trying to avoid. Dirty/smelly cars, incompetent, rude drivers, and overall not so pleasant experiences is what I've seen as of lately. The more they try to hire drivers, the worse the company is becoming. They are in this acquisition mode where they are sacrificing the quality of the company name and the reason why people chose Uber over regular taxi services in the first place. My most recent issue actually has to do with the terrible customer service of Uber themselves, rather than the smelly and dirty car rides I've been receiving. I was charged twice, on 2 separate days, for the same car ride and tried getting in contact with customer service to resolve the issue. However, there is no phone number to call and speak with anyone, and their support email is not reliable at all. I emailed my problem and heard \xa0back right away saying they would look into it, and then I didn't hear back for a week so I followed up and then I did not get any responses even after I mentioned I'd put a dispute in with my CC company for the charge, which I did, and did not receive response that would help the situation in any way. This was such an easy fix, and it wasn't even a lot of money, but the fact that they can't even do this for their customers is just ridiculous. They have lost my loyalty, and thousands of dollars a year from me since I was a very good customer being that I travel a lot for work. Perhaps I will switch to Lyft and see if that's any better.",
 u'        1/27/2015    i will never use this service again. the driver stole my wallet and i wanted to report him but there was nobody who i could report it to. it was the sketchiest experience and i will never make this mistake. stay away from these scam services!',
 u"        1/14/2015    couldn't really believe my most recent experience with Uber. As I had a lot of suitcases with me, I took an Uber from lower westchester into the east village to stay overnight. From the beginning of the trip I plugged in my destination into the Uber app, which mapped out a route that was said to take no more than 20 minutes via the Bronx River Parkway and FDR drive. My Uber driver, LaToya if any of you ever come across her, agreed from the beginning of the trip to follow what the GPS said. As the trip was going along, I checked my Uber app and realized LaToya was taking the Harlem River Drive down to Manhattan, which is congested with traffic and lights that make the trip much longer than necessary. I took a screenshot of her car being blatantly off the route I asked her to drive on and confronted her about the situation to which she nervously tried to lie about. When I contacted customer service, an employee named Kris, of course, sided with the driver in a scheme to essentially get as much money as they could out of me, which was $63. In the past, I've taken Ubers from lower Brooklyn to the same area in westchester than have costed the same amount. Long story short, avoid Uber. Take Lyft, a yellow cab, a train, a bicycle, or anything else instead."]
